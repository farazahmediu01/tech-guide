Traffic engineering exposes your Kubernetes agent to the world with safe ingress, routing, and autoscaling. You build a `traffic-engineer` skill that covers Gateway API (the Ingress successor), Envoy Gateway, rate limiting, TLS, traffic splitting, and KEDA-based scaling.

* * *

## Goals​

  * Understand Gateway API concepts and deploy Envoy Gateway
  * Route traffic with HTTPRoute (paths, headers, query matching)
  * Apply rate limiting, retries, timeouts, and circuit breaking
  * Terminate TLS with CertManager
  * Run canary/blue-green splits and autoscale with KEDA
  * Manage LLM traffic with Envoy AI Gateway patterns
  * Package the patterns into a reusable traffic-engineer skill


* * *

## Lesson Progression​

  * **L00** : Build Your Traffic Engineering Skill
  * **L01-L03** : Ingress fundamentals → Gateway API concepts
  * **L04-L06** : Envoy Gateway setup; routing; rate limiting and resilience
  * **L07-L08** : TLS with CertManager; traffic splitting (canary/blue-green)
  * **L09-L10** : KEDA autoscaling; resilience patterns
  * **L11** : Envoy AI Gateway for LLM traffic
  * **L12** : Capstone—production traffic for the Task API; finalize the skill


Each lesson ends with a reflection to test, find gaps, and improve the skill.

* * *

## Outcome & Method​

You finish with production-ready ingress for the Task API: Gateway API + Envoy Gateway, TLS, rate limiting, resilience, canary/blue-green, KEDA autoscaling, and AI Gateway patterns—plus a reusable traffic-engineer skill. The chapter follows the skill-first flow: learn, apply, capstone, finalize.

## Prerequisites​

  * Chapters 79-85 (containerized, deployed, observable service)
  * Gateway/Helm familiarity for controller installs
