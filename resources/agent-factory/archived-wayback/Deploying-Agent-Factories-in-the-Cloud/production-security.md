You build a `cloud-security` skill first, then apply it to harden your Kubernetes agent: identity, network, workloads, secrets, supply chain, and compliance checks.

* * *

## Goals​

  * Apply the 4C’s model: Cloud → Cluster → Container → Code
  * Enforce Kubernetes security: RBAC, NetworkPolicies, Pod Security Standards
  * Harden containers: image scanning, non-root users, seccomp/apparmor
  * Protect secrets: external stores and sealed/encrypted patterns
  * Add compliance and auditing: policy-as-code, admission controls
  * Capture security patterns in a reusable skill


* * *

## Lesson Progression​

  * Build Your Cloud Security Skill (skill-first)
  * Cloud/Cluster security: RBAC, NetworkPolicies, PSS
  * Container security: scanning, users, seccomp/apparmor
  * Secrets management and signing/supply-chain hygiene
  * Compliance and policy-as-code (admission controls, audit)
  * Capstone: hardened Task API deployment; finalize the skill


Each lesson ends with a reflection to test, find gaps, and improve.

## Outcome & Method​

You finish with a hardened, compliant Task API deployment and a reusable cloud-security skill. The chapter follows the skill-first pattern with a spec-driven capstone.

## Prerequisites​

  * Chapters 79-86 (containerized, deployed, observable, routed service)
  * Familiarity with GitOps to apply security manifests
