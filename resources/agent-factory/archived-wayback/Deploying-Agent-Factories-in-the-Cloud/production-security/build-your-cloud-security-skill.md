In January 2024, a major cryptocurrency exchange lost $230 million because an attacker exploited misconfigured Kubernetes RBAC—a service account with cluster-admin privileges was exposed through a debugging pod left running in production. The attacker didn't break encryption or exploit zero-days. They walked through a door that should have been locked.

Your Task API is running in Kubernetes. Before learning how to protect it—configuring RBAC, isolating network traffic, enforcing Pod Security Standards—you will **own** a cloud-security skill that generates secure configurations from day one.

This skill becomes a component of your sellable Digital FTE portfolio. By the end of this chapter, you will have a production-tested skill that implements defense-in-depth security for any Kubernetes workload.

## Step 1: Get the Skills Lab​

  1. Go to [github.com/panaversity/claude-code-skills-lab](<https://github.com/panaversity/claude-code-skills-lab>)
  2. Click the green **Code** button
  3. Select **Download ZIP**
  4. Extract the ZIP file
  5. Open the extracted folder in your terminal


    
    
    cd claude-code-skills-lab  
    claude  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    Claude Code v1.0.0  
    Type your message or ? for help  
      
    >

## Step 2: Write Your LEARNING-SPEC.md​

Before asking Claude to build your skill, define what you want to learn. Create a file named `LEARNING-SPEC.md`:
    
    
    # Cloud Security Learning Specification  
      
    ## What  
    A skill for securing Kubernetes workloads using:  
    - RBAC (Roles, RoleBindings, ServiceAccounts)  
    - NetworkPolicies (default deny, explicit allow)  
    - Pod Security Standards (PSS enforcement)  
    - Secrets management (External Secrets Operator patterns)  
    - Image scanning (Trivy integration)  
    - Dapr security (mTLS, component scopes)  
      
    ## Why  
    Production AI agents handle sensitive data and make autonomous decisions.  
    A single misconfiguration—an overprivileged service account, missing  
    network isolation, a container running as root—can expose the entire  
    cluster. The 4C security model (Cloud, Cluster, Container, Code)  
    provides defense-in-depth.  
      
    ## Success Criteria  
    - [ ] Skill generates valid ServiceAccount + Role + RoleBinding YAML  
    - [ ] kubectl apply --dry-run=client accepts generated configurations  
    - [ ] Skill enforces least privilege (no wildcards in RBAC rules)  
    - [ ] Skill references official Kubernetes security documentation  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    LEARNING-SPEC.md created (892 bytes)  
    

This specification tells Claude exactly what you need and how you will measure success.

* * *

## Step 3: Fetch Official Documentation​

Ask Claude to gather the authoritative source material:
    
    
    Using your Context7 skill, fetch the official Kubernetes security  
    documentation. I need to understand RBAC (Roles, ClusterRoles,  
    RoleBindings), NetworkPolicy, and Pod Security Standards.  
    

Claude will retrieve documentation from the official Kubernetes project, giving your skill accurate, up-to-date patterns rather than hallucinated configurations.

**Output:**
    
    
    Fetching Kubernetes security documentation via Context7...  
      
    Retrieved:  
    - RBAC authorization patterns  
    - NetworkPolicy specification  
    - Pod Security Standards (Privileged, Baseline, Restricted)  
    - Secrets management best practices  
    - Security context configuration  
      
    Documentation ready for skill creation.  
    

* * *

## Step 4: Create Your Skill​

Now prompt Claude to build the skill using the fetched documentation:
    
    
    Using your skill creator skill, create a new skill for Kubernetes security.  
    I will use it to secure Python/FastAPI applications from dev to production.  
    Cover RBAC, NetworkPolicies, Pod Security Standards, secrets management,  
    image scanning with Trivy, and Dapr security. Use the Kubernetes security  
    docs you just fetched.  
    

Claude will:

  1. Study the fetched documentation
  2. Ask clarifying questions about your security requirements
  3. Create the skill with security templates and best practices


**Output:**
    
    
    Creating cloud-security skill...  
      
    Questions:  
    1. Should I include patterns for External Secrets Operator?  
    2. What base PSS level should be the default (baseline or restricted)?  
    3. Do you need Dapr-specific security patterns?  
      
    [After your answers]  
      
    Skill created at .claude/skills/cloud-security/  
    - SKILL.md: Core patterns and decision trees  
    - templates/: RBAC, NetworkPolicy, PSS examples  
    - references/: Links to official documentation  
    

Your skill appears at `.claude/skills/cloud-security/`.

* * *

## Step 5: Test Your Skill​

Verify your new skill generates valid Kubernetes YAML:
    
    
    Using my cloud-security skill, show me how to create a dedicated  
    ServiceAccount for my Task API with minimal permissions.  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    # task-api-rbac.yaml  
    apiVersion: v1  
    kind: ServiceAccount  
    metadata:  
      name: task-api-sa  
      namespace: task-api  
    automountServiceAccountToken: false  
    ---  
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1  
    kind: Role  
    metadata:  
      name: task-api-role  
      namespace: task-api  
    rules:  
    - apiGroups: [""]  
      resources: ["configmaps"]  
      verbs: ["get", "list"]  
    ---  
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1  
    kind: RoleBinding  
    metadata:  
      name: task-api-binding  
      namespace: task-api  
    subjects:  
    - kind: ServiceAccount  
      name: task-api-sa  
    roleRef:  
      kind: Role  
      name: task-api-role  
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io  
    

Save the output and validate:
    
    
    kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f task-api-rbac.yaml  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    serviceaccount/task-api-sa created (dry run)  
    role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/task-api-role created (dry run)  
    rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/task-api-binding created (dry run)  
    

If dry-run succeeds, your skill generates valid RBAC configurations following least privilege principles. Notice that the Role specifies only `configmaps` with `get` and `list` verbs—no wildcards, no cluster-wide access.

## Done​

You now own a cloud-security skill built from official Kubernetes security documentation. The rest of this chapter teaches you what it knows—and how to make it better.

## Try With AI​

Now that you have a working skill, test its gap identification capabilities.

**Prompt 1:**
    
    
    Using my cloud-security skill, show me how to create a dedicated  
    ServiceAccount for my Task API with minimal permissions.  
    

**What you're learning:** How your skill generates RBAC patterns following least privilege. Notice whether it avoids wildcards (*) in verbs and resources, and whether it suggests `automountServiceAccountToken: false` by default.

**Prompt 2:**
    
    
    What's missing from this skill for production workloads?  
    

**What you're learning:** Gap identification is a critical meta-skill. Your skill might be missing NetworkPolicy defaults, PSS enforcement labels, Trivy scanning integration, or Dapr component scopes. Each gap becomes a learning target for this chapter's lessons.

Security Reminder

Never test security configurations on production clusters. Always use `--dry-run=client` first, then apply to a development namespace. Security misconfigurations can expose your entire cluster.
