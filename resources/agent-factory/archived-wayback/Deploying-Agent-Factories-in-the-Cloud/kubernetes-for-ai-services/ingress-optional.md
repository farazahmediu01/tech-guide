Your agent running in Kubernetes handles thousands of requests. But how does traffic reach it? In Lesson 5, you learned about Services—the stable interfaces to your Pods. LoadBalancer Services work well for simple cases, but production systems need something more powerful: **Ingress**.

Ingress lets you expose HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within it. Unlike LoadBalancer, which creates a cloud load balancer for every service (expensive), Ingress shares one load balancer across multiple services. You can route requests based on hostname, URL path, or both. You can terminate TLS for HTTPS. You can even implement A/B testing by routing different traffic percentages to different versions of your agent.

Think of it this way: LoadBalancer is a direct tunnel to one service. Ingress is an intelligent receptionist—it looks at your request, reads the address and directions, and routes you to the right department.

## Why LoadBalancer Isn't Enough​

**The Cost Problem**

Every LoadBalancer Service you create provisions a cloud load balancer. On AWS, that's $16/month per load balancer. With 10 services, you're paying $160/month just for load balancers. Ingress shares one load balancer across all services—one $16/month bill instead of ten.

**The Feature Gap**

LoadBalancer gives you Layer 4 routing (TCP/UDP based on port). It knows nothing about HTTP. Ingress gives you Layer 7 routing:

  * Route `/api/v1/` requests to the stable agent version
  * Route `/api/v2/beta/` requests to the experimental agent
  * Route `dashboard.example.com` to monitoring, `api.example.com` to your agent
  * Terminate TLS for HTTPS
  * Implement request rewriting
  * Control access with rate limiting


**The Management Problem**

With LoadBalancer, every service is exposed separately. You're managing multiple external IPs, each with different security rules. With Ingress, you have one entrypoint—one place to manage TLS certificates, one place to enforce security policies.

## Ingress Architecture: Controller and Resource​

Ingress has two parts: a **resource** (declarative specification) and a **controller** (the process that implements it).

### The Ingress Resource​

The Ingress resource is a Kubernetes API object—like Deployment or Service. It specifies your desired routing rules:
    
    
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1  
    kind: Ingress  
    metadata:  
      name: agent-ingress  
    spec:  
      ingressClassName: nginx  
      rules:  
      - host: api.example.com  
        http:  
          paths:  
          - path: /api/v1/  
            backend:  
              service:  
                name: agent-stable  
                port:  
                  number: 8000  
          - path: /api/v2/beta/  
            backend:  
              service:  
                name: agent-experimental  
                port:  
                  number: 8000  
    

This says: "Listen on api.example.com, route requests to `/api/v1/` to the agent-stable service, route requests to `/api/v2/beta/` to the agent-experimental service."

The resource is just a specification. It does nothing by itself.

### The Ingress Controller​

The **Ingress controller** reads Ingress resources and implements them. It's a Pod running in your cluster that watches for Ingress resources, then configures a real load balancer (nginx, HAProxy, cloud provider's LB) to actually route traffic.

Popular controllers:

  * **nginx-ingress** (open source, works everywhere)
  * **AWS ALB** (AWS-native, integrates with ELBv2)
  * **GCP Cloud Armor** (GCP-native)
  * **Kong** (commercial-grade API gateway)


For this chapter, we'll use nginx-ingress because it works on Docker Desktop, cloud clusters, and on-premises Kubernetes.

## Installing nginx-ingress on Docker Desktop​

Install nginx-ingress using kubectl:
    
    
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.8.2/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    namespace/ingress-nginx created  
    serviceaccount/ingress-nginx created  
    ...  
    deployment.apps/ingress-nginx-controller created  
    

Verify the controller is running:
    
    
    kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    NAMESPACE       NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE  
    ingress-nginx   ingress-nginx-admission-patch-xxxxx        0/1     Completed   0          2m  
    ingress-nginx   ingress-nginx-admission-create-xxxxx       0/1     Completed   0          2m  
    ingress-nginx   ingress-nginx-controller-yyyyy             1/1     Running     0          2m  
    

The `ingress-nginx-controller` is the daemon watching your cluster for Ingress resources. When you create an Ingress, this controller reads it and configures nginx to route traffic accordingly.

Check which IngressClass is available:
    
    
    kubectl get ingressclasses  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    NAME    CONTROLLER                       AGE  
    nginx   k8s.io/ingress-nginx/nginx       2m  
    

The `nginx` IngressClass is your controller. When you create an Ingress with `ingressClassName: nginx`, this controller takes responsibility for implementing it.

## Path-Based Routing: Versioned APIs​

Your agent has evolved. You have a stable `/api/v1/` endpoint that clients rely on, and a new `/api/v2/beta/` endpoint with experimental features. Different Deployments run each version:
    
    
    kubectl create deployment agent-v1 --image=your-registry/agent:v1 --replicas=2  
    kubectl create deployment agent-v2 --image=your-registry/agent:v2 --replicas=1  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    deployment.apps/agent-v1 created  
    deployment.apps/agent-v2 created  
    

Expose each as a Service:
    
    
    kubectl expose deployment agent-v1 --port=8000 --target-port=8000 --name=agent-v1-service  
    kubectl expose deployment agent-v2 --port=8000 --target-port=8000 --name=agent-v2-service  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    service/agent-v1-service exposed  
    service/agent-v2-service exposed  
    

Verify both services exist:
    
    
    kubectl get svc | grep agent  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    NAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)  
    agent-v1-service   ClusterIP   10.96.200.50    <none>        8000/TCP  
    agent-v2-service   ClusterIP   10.96.201.100   <none>        8000/TCP  
    

Now create an Ingress to route traffic to both:
    
    
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1  
    kind: Ingress  
    metadata:  
      name: agent-path-routing  
    spec:  
      ingressClassName: nginx  
      rules:  
      - host: localhost  # For Docker Desktop testing  
        http:  
          paths:  
          - path: /api/v1  
            pathType: Prefix  
            backend:  
              service:  
                name: agent-v1-service  
                port:  
                  number: 8000  
          - path: /api/v2/beta  
            pathType: Prefix  
            backend:  
              service:  
                name: agent-v2-service  
                port:  
                  number: 8000  
    

Save as `agent-path-routing.yaml` and apply:
    
    
    kubectl apply -f agent-path-routing.yaml  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    ingress.networking.k8s.io/agent-path-routing created  
    

Verify the Ingress is configured:
    
    
    kubectl get ingress  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    NAME                   CLASS   HOSTS      ADDRESS        PORTS   AGE  
    agent-path-routing     nginx   localhost  192.168.49.2   80      10s  
    

The ADDRESS is your localhost. Wait a moment for nginx to configure, then test:
    
    
    curl http://localhost/api/v1/health  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0"}  
    
    
    
    curl http://localhost/api/v2/beta/health  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    {"status": "healthy", "version": "2.0-beta", "experimental": true}  
    

The same Ingress gateway routes `/api/v1` and `/api/v2/beta` to different backend services. This is the power of path-based routing—one IP, multiple APIs, each backed by independent Deployments.

## Host-Based Routing: Multiple Domains​

Your team operates multiple services from one cluster:

  * `agent.example.com` — Your AI agent API
  * `dashboard.example.com` — Monitoring dashboard
  * `webhook.example.com` — Event receiver


Each has its own Service. Host-based Ingress routes traffic to the right Service based on the hostname:
    
    
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1  
    kind: Ingress  
    metadata:  
      name: agent-host-routing  
    spec:  
      ingressClassName: nginx  
      rules:  
      - host: agent.example.com  
        http:  
          paths:  
          - path: /  
            pathType: Prefix  
            backend:  
              service:  
                name: agent-service  
                port:  
                  number: 8000  
      - host: dashboard.example.com  
        http:  
          paths:  
          - path: /  
            pathType: Prefix  
            backend:  
              service:  
                name: dashboard-service  
                port:  
                  number: 3000  
      - host: webhook.example.com  
        http:  
          paths:  
          - path: /  
            pathType: Prefix  
            backend:  
              service:  
                name: webhook-service  
                port:  
                  number: 5000  
    

Apply this configuration:
    
    
    kubectl apply -f agent-host-routing.yaml  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    ingress.networking.k8s.io/agent-host-routing created  
    

Verify the Ingress configuration:
    
    
    kubectl get ingress agent-host-routing -o wide  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    NAME                   CLASS   HOSTS                                          ADDRESS        PORTS   AGE  
    agent-host-routing     nginx   agent.example.com,dashboard.example.com,...   192.168.49.2   80      30s  
    

Test locally by modifying `/etc/hosts` (or adding entries to your DNS):
    
    
    echo "192.168.49.2 agent.example.com dashboard.example.com webhook.example.com" >> /etc/hosts  
    cat /etc/hosts | tail -1  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    192.168.49.2 agent.example.com dashboard.example.com webhook.example.com  
    

Then test each hostname:
    
    
    curl http://agent.example.com/health  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    {"status": "healthy", "service": "agent", "uptime_seconds": 3600}  
    
    
    
    curl http://dashboard.example.com/  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    <html>Dashboard - 12 agents online, 0 errors</html>  
    

The same Ingress controller routes three different hostnames to three different services. This is the foundation of multi-tenant deployments—one gateway, many applications.

## TLS Termination for HTTPS​

Internet traffic should be encrypted. Kubernetes TLS termination means the Ingress handles encryption/decryption, so backend services communicate in plain HTTP internally (they're protected by the network).

### Create a Self-Signed Certificate (for testing)​
    
    
    openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \  
      -keyout /tmp/tls.key \  
      -out /tmp/tls.crt \  
      -subj "/CN=agent.example.com"  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    Generating a RSA private key  
    ...................................................+++++  
    Generating a self signed certificate  
    ...  
    

### Create a TLS Secret​

Kubernetes stores certificates in Secrets. Create one with your TLS key and certificate:
    
    
    kubectl create secret tls agent-tls \  
      --cert=/tmp/tls.crt \  
      --key=/tmp/tls.key  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    secret/agent-tls created  
    

Verify the secret:
    
    
    kubectl get secret agent-tls  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    NAME         TYPE                DATA   AGE  
    agent-tls    kubernetes.io/tls   2      5s  
    

### Update Ingress with TLS​

Modify your Ingress to reference the TLS secret:
    
    
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1  
    kind: Ingress  
    metadata:  
      name: agent-tls-ingress  
    spec:  
      ingressClassName: nginx  
      tls:  
      - hosts:  
        - agent.example.com  
        secretName: agent-tls  
      rules:  
      - host: agent.example.com  
        http:  
          paths:  
          - path: /  
            pathType: Prefix  
            backend:  
              service:  
                name: agent-service  
                port:  
                  number: 8000  
    

Apply:
    
    
    kubectl apply -f agent-tls-ingress.yaml  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    ingress.networking.k8s.io/agent-tls-ingress created  
    

Test HTTPS:
    
    
    curl --insecure https://agent.example.com/health  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    {"status": "healthy", "tls": "yes"}  
    

(We use `--insecure` because the self-signed certificate isn't in your system's trust store. In production, you'd use a certificate from a trusted CA like Let's Encrypt.)

The Ingress controller (nginx) terminates TLS—it decrypts incoming HTTPS traffic and routes requests to your services over plain HTTP. This simplifies certificate management (one place to update certs) and reduces computational burden on your agent services.

Verify the TLS secret is mounted correctly:
    
    
    kubectl describe ingress agent-tls-ingress  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    Name:             agent-tls-ingress  
    Namespace:        default  
    Address:          192.168.49.2  
    Default backend:  default-http-backend:80 (<error: endpoints "default-http-backend" not found>)  
    TLS:  
      agent-tls terminates agent.example.com  
    Rules:  
      Host                   Path  Backends  
      ----                   ----  --------  
      agent.example.com  
                             /     agent-service:8000 (10.244.0.10:8000,10.244.0.11:8000)  
    Annotations:  
      <none>  
    Events:                  <none>  
    

The TLS configuration is active. The nginx controller has loaded your certificate and key from the `agent-tls` secret.

## A/B Testing with Traffic Splitting​

Your team wants to validate a new agent version with 10% of traffic while keeping 90% on the stable version. You can't do this with basic routing—you need **weighted traffic splitting**.

Create two Services:
    
    
    kubectl create deployment agent-stable --image=agent:v1.0 --replicas=9  
    kubectl create deployment agent-test --image=agent:v2.0-rc1 --replicas=1  
    kubectl expose deployment agent-stable --port=8000 --name=agent-stable  
    kubectl expose deployment agent-test --port=8000 --name=agent-test  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    deployment.apps/agent-stable created  
    deployment.apps/agent-test created  
    service/agent-stable exposed  
    service/agent-test exposed  
    

With nginx-ingress, you can use the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/service-weights` annotation:
    
    
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1  
    kind: Ingress  
    metadata:  
      name: agent-canary  
      annotations:  
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/service-weights: |  
          agent-stable: 90  
          agent-test: 10  
    spec:  
      ingressClassName: nginx  
      rules:  
      - host: api.example.com  
        http:  
          paths:  
          - path: /  
            pathType: Prefix  
            backend:  
              service:  
                name: agent-stable  
                port:  
                  number: 8000  
    

Apply:
    
    
    kubectl apply -f agent-canary.yaml  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    ingress.networking.k8s.io/agent-canary created  
    

Send 100 requests and observe traffic distribution:
    
    
    for i in {1..100}; do curl http://api.example.com/version; done | sort | uniq -c  
    

**Output:**
    
    
          90 {"version": "1.0", "stable": true}  
          10 {"version": "2.0-rc1", "canary": true}  
    

Roughly 90% reach the stable version, 10% reach the test version. This lets you validate new code with real traffic before full rollout.

## Ingress Annotations: Advanced Configuration​

Annotations let you customize Ingress behavior without changing the core specification. Common annotations for nginx-ingress:

### Rate Limiting​

Protect your agent from being overwhelmed by limiting requests per client:
    
    
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1  
    kind: Ingress  
    metadata:  
      name: agent-rate-limited  
      annotations:  
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps: "100"  
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-connections: "10"  
    spec:  
      ingressClassName: nginx  
      rules:  
      - host: api.example.com  
        http:  
          paths:  
          - path: /  
            pathType: Prefix  
            backend:  
              service:  
                name: agent-service  
                port:  
                  number: 8000  
    

Apply and test:
    
    
    kubectl apply -f agent-rate-limited.yaml  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    ingress.networking.k8s.io/agent-rate-limited created  
    

Verify the annotations are applied:
    
    
    kubectl get ingress agent-rate-limited -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations}'  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    {"nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-connections":"10","nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps":"100"}  
    

### CORS Headers​

Allow browser clients from specific origins to call your agent:
    
    
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1  
    kind: Ingress  
    metadata:  
      name: agent-cors  
      annotations:  
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors: "true"  
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-origin: "https://dashboard.example.com"  
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-methods: "GET, POST, PUT"  
    spec:  
      ingressClassName: nginx  
      rules:  
      - host: api.example.com  
        http:  
          paths:  
          - path: /  
            pathType: Prefix  
            backend:  
              service:  
                name: agent-service  
                port:  
                  number: 8000  
    

Apply:
    
    
    kubectl apply -f agent-cors.yaml  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    ingress.networking.k8s.io/agent-cors created  
    

## Debugging Ingress Issues​

When routing fails, use these kubectl commands to diagnose:

### Check Ingress Status​
    
    
    kubectl get ingress  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    NAME              CLASS   HOSTS              ADDRESS        PORTS   AGE  
    agent-ingress     nginx   api.example.com    192.168.49.2   80      5m  
    

If ADDRESS is `<none>`, the ingress controller hasn't assigned an IP yet (usually means services don't exist).

### Describe Ingress Details​
    
    
    kubectl describe ingress agent-ingress  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    Name:             agent-ingress  
    Namespace:        default  
    Address:          192.168.49.2  
    Ingress Class:    nginx  
    Host(s)           Path  Backends  
    ----              ----  --------  
    api.example.com  
                      /api/v1    agent-v1-service:8000  
                      /api/v2    agent-v2-service:8000  
    Annotations:      <none>  
    Events:  
      Type    Reason  Age   From                      Message  
      ----    ------  ----  ----                      -------  
      Normal  Sync    30s   nginx-ingress-controller  Scheduled for sync  
    

This shows exactly what rules are configured and which backends they target.

### Check Controller Logs​
    
    
    kubectl logs -n ingress-nginx -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx -f  
    

**Output (example):**
    
    
    I1222 10:45:23.123456   12345 main.go:104] Starting NGINX Ingress Controller  
    I1222 10:45:24.234567   12345 store.go:123] Found Ingress api.example.com  
    I1222 10:45:25.345678   12345 controller.go:456] Sync: agent-ingress  
    I1222 10:45:26.456789   12345 template.go:789] Generating NGINX config  
    

Logs show when the controller detects new Ingress resources and updates its configuration.

### Test Connectivity​

If the Ingress won't route traffic, verify the backend Service:
    
    
    kubectl port-forward svc/agent-v1-service 8000:8000  
    

In another terminal:
    
    
    curl http://localhost:8000/health  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0"}  
    

If this works but Ingress routing doesn't, the problem is in the Ingress controller configuration, not the Service.

### Common Issues and Solutions​

**Issue: "Service not found" errors in Ingress**

Check the Service exists in the correct namespace:
    
    
    kubectl get svc agent-v1-service  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    NAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)  
    agent-v1-service    ClusterIP   10.96.200.50    <none>        8000/TCP  
    

**Issue: 503 Service Unavailable**

The Ingress exists but backends are unhealthy:
    
    
    kubectl describe svc agent-v1-service  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    Name:              agent-v1-service  
    Endpoints:         10.244.0.10:8000,10.244.0.11:8000  
    

If Endpoints is empty, Pods aren't running or labels don't match.

## Try With AI​

**Setup** : You have two agent services running in your cluster: `chat-agent` and `tool-agent`. Both listen on port 8000. You want to expose them via Ingress so:

  * `http://api.example.com/chat/*` routes to `chat-agent`
  * `http://api.example.com/tools/*` routes to `tool-agent`
  * Both should be accessible over HTTPS using a self-signed certificate


**Part 1: Ask AI for the Ingress design**

Prompt AI:
    
    
    I have two Kubernetes services:  
    - chat-agent (port 8000)  
    - tool-agent (port 8000)  
      
    I need an Ingress that:  
    1. Routes /chat/* to chat-agent  
    2. Routes /tools/* to tool-agent  
    3. Uses HTTPS with a TLS secret named "api-tls"  
    4. Uses nginx-ingress controller  
      
    Design the Ingress YAML that accomplishes this. What decisions did you make about pathType, backend configuration, and TLS placement?  
    

**Part 2: Evaluate the design**

Review AI's response. Ask yourself:

  * Does each path rule specify correct service and port?
  * Is the TLS configuration in the spec.tls section?
  * Did AI explain why certain pathTypes (Exact vs Prefix) were chosen?
  * Are both hosts unified under one Ingress or separate Ingresses?


**Part 3: Test the design**

Create the services (if not already running):
    
    
    kubectl create deployment chat-agent --image=your-registry/chat-agent:latest  
    kubectl create deployment tool-agent --image=your-registry/tool-agent:latest  
    kubectl expose deployment chat-agent --port=8000 --name=chat-agent  
    kubectl expose deployment tool-agent --port=8000 --name=tool-agent  
    

Create the TLS secret:
    
    
    openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \  
      -keyout /tmp/api.key -out /tmp/api.crt -subj "/CN=api.example.com"  
    kubectl create secret tls api-tls --cert=/tmp/api.crt --key=/tmp/api.key  
    

Apply AI's Ingress:
    
    
    kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml  # The YAML AI generated  
    

Test routing:
    
    
    curl --insecure https://api.example.com/chat/hello  
    curl --insecure https://api.example.com/tools/list  
    

**Part 4: Refinement**

If routing works:

  * What annotations might improve this Ingress (rate limiting, CORS handling)?
  * How would you add health checks to ensure failed backends are removed?


If routing fails:

  * Check logs: `kubectl logs -n ingress-nginx <ingress-controller-pod>`
  * Verify services exist: `kubectl get svc`
  * Test Service connectivity directly: `kubectl port-forward svc/chat-agent 8000:8000`
  * Verify TLS secret: `kubectl get secret api-tls`


**Part 5: Compare to your design**

When you started, you might have created separate Ingresses per service. Look at AI's consolidated design:

  * Why is one Ingress cleaner than two?
  * What shared configuration (TLS, IngressClass) benefits from consolidation?
  * When would you split into multiple Ingresses (different namespaces, different IngressClasses)?
