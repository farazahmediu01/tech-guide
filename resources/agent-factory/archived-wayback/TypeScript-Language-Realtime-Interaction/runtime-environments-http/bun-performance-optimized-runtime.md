Your CLI tool processes AI prompts. Users type a command, wait for the runtime to start, then wait again for the AI response. With Node.js, that first wait is 120-200 milliseconds. Users notice. It feels sluggish. Now imagine that startup happening in 30-50 milliseconds—so fast the tool feels instant.

Bun makes this possible. Built on JavaScriptCore (Safari's JavaScript engine) instead of V8 (Chrome's engine), Bun optimizes for what matters in CLI tools and serverless functions: cold start time. It starts 3-4x faster than Node.js, runs TypeScript natively, and bundles an entire development toolkit—package manager, bundler, test runner—into a single binary.

This lesson teaches you Bun as the performance runtime for AI developer tools. You'll understand when Bun's speed advantage matters, how to build HTTP servers with `Bun.serve()`, and how to leverage the all-in-one toolchain that eliminates webpack-jest-npm sprawl.

## Why JavaScriptCore? The Engine Difference​

Node.js and Deno use V8, Chrome's JavaScript engine. V8 excels at long-running processes—it aggressively optimizes code that runs repeatedly, making servers that run for days extremely fast. But that optimization has a cost: startup time.

Bun uses JavaScriptCore, Safari's engine. JavaScriptCore takes a different approach: lighter initial overhead, faster startup, lower memory usage. The trade-off is less aggressive long-term optimization—but for processes that start, run briefly, and exit, this trade-off is exactly right.

Characteristic| V8 (Node.js, Deno)| JavaScriptCore (Bun)  
---|---|---  
**Cold start**|  ~120-200ms| ~30-50ms  
**Long-running optimization**|  Aggressive (gets faster over time)| Moderate  
**Memory usage**|  Higher baseline| Lower baseline  
**Best for**|  Servers running 24/7| CLI tools, serverless, short-lived processes  
  
### Real-World Impact​

For a CLI tool that calls an AI API:
    
    
    Node.js timeline:  
    [~150ms startup] [~50ms code execution] [~2000ms AI API call] [~10ms output]  
    Total: ~2210ms  
      
    Bun timeline:  
    [~40ms startup] [~50ms code execution] [~2000ms AI API call] [~10ms output]  
    Total: ~2100ms  
    

That 110ms difference makes the tool feel noticeably snappier. For serverless functions that scale to zero and cold-start frequently, the savings compound across thousands of invocations.

## Native TypeScript: Just Run It​

Like Deno, Bun runs TypeScript directly. Unlike Node.js 22's experimental type stripping, Bun's TypeScript support is stable and complete:
    
    
    // src/hello.ts - runs directly with Bun  
    interface Greeting {  
      message: string;  
      timestamp: Date;  
    }  
      
    function greet(name: string): Greeting {  
      return {  
        message: `Hello, ${name}!`,  
        timestamp: new Date(),  
      };  
    }  
      
    const result = greet("Bun");  
    console.log(result);  
    

Run it:
    
    
    bun run src/hello.ts  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    {  
      message: "Hello, Bun!",  
      timestamp: 2026-01-01T12:00:00.000Z  
    }  
    

No compilation step. No tsconfig.json required. No `--experimental-strip-types` flag. Bun transpiles TypeScript internally using its native transpiler, which is significantly faster than tsc.

### TypeScript Performance Comparison​
    
    
    # Node.js 22 with type stripping  
    time node --experimental-strip-types src/hello.ts  
    # real: 0.15s  
      
    # Bun  
    time bun run src/hello.ts  
    # real: 0.04s  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    # Bun starts 3-4x faster for simple scripts  
    

For AI CLI tools that users invoke frequently, this difference accumulates into a noticeably better experience.

## Bun.serve(): High-Performance HTTP Servers​

Bun's HTTP server API is designed for performance. In benchmarks, Bun.serve() handles approximately 52,000-70,000 requests per second, compared to Node.js's 13,000-25,000—roughly 3-4x the throughput on equivalent hardware.

### Basic Server​
    
    
    // src/server.ts  
    Bun.serve({  
      port: 3000,  
      fetch(req) {  
        return new Response("Hello from Bun!");  
      },  
    });  
      
    console.log("Server running at http://localhost:3000");  
    

Run it:
    
    
    bun run src/server.ts  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    Server running at http://localhost:3000  
    

The API is clean: a single `fetch` handler that receives a Request and returns a Response. These are standard Web API objects—the same Request and Response you use in browsers and Deno.

### Routing with URL Pattern Matching​
    
    
    // src/api-server.ts  
    Bun.serve({  
      port: 3000,  
      fetch(req) {  
        const url = new URL(req.url);  
      
        if (url.pathname === "/health") {  
          return new Response("OK");  
        }  
      
        if (url.pathname === "/api/chat" && req.method === "POST") {  
          return handleChat(req);  
        }  
      
        if (url.pathname === "/api/models") {  
          return Response.json({  
            models: ["gpt-4", "claude-3-sonnet", "gemini-pro"],  
          });  
        }  
      
        return new Response("Not Found", { status: 404 });  
      },  
    });  
      
    async function handleChat(req: Request): Promise<Response> {  
      const body = await req.json();  
      const { message } = body as { message: string };  
      
      // Simulate AI response  
      return Response.json({  
        response: `You said: ${message}`,  
        model: "mock-model",  
      });  
    }  
      
    console.log("API server running at http://localhost:3000");  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    $ curl http://localhost:3000/api/models  
    {"models":["gpt-4","claude-3-sonnet","gemini-pro"]}  
      
    $ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \  
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \  
      -d '{"message": "Hello"}'  
    {"response":"You said: Hello","model":"mock-model"}  
    

### Streaming Responses for AI​

AI responses stream token by token. Bun.serve() handles streaming naturally:
    
    
    // src/streaming-server.ts  
    Bun.serve({  
      port: 3000,  
      async fetch(req) {  
        const url = new URL(req.url);  
      
        if (url.pathname === "/stream") {  
          return streamResponse();  
        }  
      
        return new Response("Use /stream endpoint");  
      },  
    });  
      
    function streamResponse(): Response {  
      const encoder = new TextEncoder();  
      
      const stream = new ReadableStream({  
        async start(controller) {  
          const tokens = ["Hello", " ", "from", " ", "streaming", " ", "Bun", "!"];  
      
          for (const token of tokens) {  
            controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(`data: ${token}\n\n`));  
            await Bun.sleep(100); // Simulate token generation delay  
          }  
      
          controller.enqueue(encoder.encode("data: [DONE]\n\n"));  
          controller.close();  
        },  
      });  
      
      return new Response(stream, {  
        headers: {  
          "Content-Type": "text/event-stream",  
          "Cache-Control": "no-cache",  
          Connection: "keep-alive",  
        },  
      });  
    }  
      
    console.log("Streaming server at http://localhost:3000/stream");  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    $ curl http://localhost:3000/stream  
    data: Hello  
      
    data:  
      
    data: from  
      
    data:  
      
    data: streaming  
      
    data:  
      
    data: Bun  
      
    data: !  
      
    data: [DONE]  
    

Notice `Bun.sleep()`—a built-in utility that doesn't require importing. Bun includes many conveniences like this that reduce boilerplate.

## The All-in-One Toolchain​

Bun isn't just a runtime. It's a complete development toolkit that replaces npm, webpack, and Jest with a single binary.

### Package Manager: bun install​

Bun's package manager is dramatically faster than npm:
    
    
    # npm  
    time npm install  
    # real: 8.5s (clean install)  
      
    # bun  
    time bun install  
    # real: 0.8s (clean install)  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    # Bun installs packages 10-25x faster than npm  
    

Bun reads `package.json` and creates a `bun.lockb` (binary lockfile) for reproducible installs. It's compatible with npm packages—your existing `package.json` works unchanged.
    
    
    # Initialize a new project  
    bun init  
      
    # Install dependencies  
    bun install  
      
    # Add a package  
    bun add openai  
      
    # Add a dev dependency  
    bun add -d typescript  
    

### Bundler: bun build​

Bun includes a bundler that's faster than esbuild (which is already very fast):
    
    
    # Bundle for production  
    bun build src/index.ts --outdir=dist --minify  
      
    # Bundle with external dependencies  
    bun build src/index.ts --outdir=dist --external openai  
      
    # Create standalone executable  
    bun build src/cli.ts --compile --outfile=my-cli  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    $ bun build src/index.ts --outdir=dist --minify  
      dist/index.js  12.4 KB  
      
    $ ls -la dist/  
    -rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  12689 Jan  1 12:00 index.js  
    

The `--compile` flag creates self-contained executables that include the Bun runtime. Users don't need Bun installed—the executable runs anywhere:
    
    
    # Create executable  
    bun build src/ai-cli.ts --compile --outfile=ai-cli  
      
    # Run it (no Bun required on target machine)  
    ./ai-cli "What is TypeScript?"  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    # Standalone binary runs without Bun installation  
    

This is powerful for distributing AI CLI tools—no runtime installation required.

### Test Runner: bun test​

Bun includes a Jest-compatible test runner:
    
    
    // src/greet.ts  
    export function greet(name: string): string {  
      return `Hello, ${name}!`;  
    }  
      
    // src/greet.test.ts  
    import { expect, test, describe } from "bun:test";  
    import { greet } from "./greet";  
      
    describe("greet", () => {  
      test("returns greeting with name", () => {  
        expect(greet("World")).toBe("Hello, World!");  
      });  
      
      test("handles empty string", () => {  
        expect(greet("")).toBe("Hello, !");  
      });  
    });  
    

Run tests:
    
    
    bun test  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    bun test v1.x  
    src/greet.test.ts:  
      greet  
        ✓ returns greeting with name [0.12ms]  
        ✓ handles empty string [0.08ms]  
      
     2 pass  
     0 fail  
     2 total  
    

The API matches Jest, so migrating existing tests is straightforward. Import from `bun:test` instead of Jest, and most tests work unchanged.

## Complete Example: AI Chat CLI​

Let's build a complete CLI tool that demonstrates Bun's strengths:
    
    
    ai-chat/  
    ├── package.json  
    ├── src/  
    │   ├── cli.ts  
    │   ├── client.ts  
    │   └── client.test.ts  
    └── bunfig.toml  
    

**package.json:**
    
    
    {  
      "name": "ai-chat",  
      "version": "1.0.0",  
      "type": "module",

        "start": "bun run src/cli.ts",  
        "test": "bun test",  
        "build": "bun build src/cli.ts --compile --outfile=ai-chat"  
      },  
      "dependencies": {  
        "openai": "^4.0.0"  
      }  
    }  
    

**src/client.ts:**
    
    
    import OpenAI from "openai";  
      
    export interface ChatOptions {  
      model?: string;  
      stream?: boolean;  
    }  
      
    export async function chat(  
      prompt: string,  
      options: ChatOptions = {}  
    ): Promise<string> {  
      const client = new OpenAI();  
      const model = options.model ?? "gpt-4";  
      
      if (options.stream) {  
        return streamChat(client, prompt, model);  
      }  
      
      const response = await client.chat.completions.create({  
        model,  
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],  
      });  
      
      return response.choices[0].message.content ?? "";  
    }  
      
    async function streamChat(  
      client: OpenAI,  
      prompt: string,  
      model: string  
    ): Promise<string> {  
      const stream = await client.chat.completions.create({  
        model,  
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],  
        stream: true,  
      });  
      
      let fullResponse = "";  
      
      for await (const chunk of stream) {  
        const content = chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content ?? "";  
        process.stdout.write(content);  
        fullResponse += content;  
      }  
      
      console.log(); // Final newline  
      return fullResponse;  
    }  
    

**src/cli.ts:**
    
    
    import { chat } from "./client";  
      
    async function main(): Promise<void> {  
      const args = process.argv.slice(2);  
      
      if (args.length === 0) {  
        console.log("Usage: ai-chat <prompt>");  
        console.log("       ai-chat --stream <prompt>");  
        process.exit(1);  
      }  
      
      const stream = args[0] === "--stream";  
      const prompt = stream ? args.slice(1).join(" ") : args.join(" ");  
      
      if (!prompt) {  
        console.error("Error: No prompt provided");  
        process.exit(1);  
      }  
      
      try {  
        await chat(prompt, { stream });  
      } catch (error) {  
        console.error("Error:", error instanceof Error ? error.message : error);  
        process.exit(1);  
      }  
    }  
      
    main();  
    

**src/client.test.ts:**
    
    
    import { expect, test, describe, mock } from "bun:test";  
    import { chat } from "./client";  
      
    describe("chat", () => {  
      test("returns response for simple prompt", async () => {  
        // In real tests, you'd mock the OpenAI client  
        // This test structure shows the pattern  
        const response = "Hello!";  
        expect(typeof response).toBe("string");  
      });  
      
      test("handles stream option", () => {  
        const options = { stream: true };  
        expect(options.stream).toBe(true);  
      });  
    });  
    

Run and build:
    
    
    # Install dependencies  
    bun install  
      
    # Run directly  
    bun run src/cli.ts "What is Bun?"  
      
    # Run tests  
    bun test  
      
    # Build standalone executable  
    bun run build  
    ./ai-chat "Explain TypeScript briefly"  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    $ bun run src/cli.ts "What is Bun?"  
    Bun is a fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, and package manager built on JavaScriptCore...  
      
    $ bun test  
     2 pass  
     0 fail  
      
    $ ./ai-chat "Hello!"  
    Hello! How can I help you today?  
    

## When to Choose Bun​

Use Case| Bun| Node.js  
---|---|---  
**CLI tools**|  3-4x faster startup, ideal UX| Acceptable, but feels slower  
**Serverless functions**|  Fast cold starts reduce latency| Cold starts noticeable in scale-to-zero  
**Local development**|  Faster installs, faster tests| Mature, but slower  
**Production APIs**|  Excellent performance| Larger ecosystem, more enterprise support  
**npm compatibility**|  ~99% compatible| 100% compatible  
**Standalone executables**|  Built-in with --compile| Requires pkg or similar  
  
**Choose Bun when:**

  * Cold start time directly impacts user experience
  * You're building CLI tools for developers
  * You want an all-in-one toolchain without webpack/Jest configuration
  * You're distributing standalone executables


**Choose Node.js when:**

  * You need 100% npm compatibility for edge-case packages
  * Enterprise support and long-term stability are priorities
  * Your infrastructure is built around Node.js (Lambda, etc.)
  * The team is more familiar with Node.js patterns


## Bun vs Deno: Performance vs Security​

You've now seen three runtimes. Here's the key distinction:

Aspect| Bun| Deno  
---|---|---  
**Primary focus**|  Performance| Security  
**Permission model**|  Trust everything (like Node.js)| Explicit permissions required  
**npm compatibility**|  Full, seamless| Full (Deno 2), via npm: specifier  
**Cold start**|  Fastest (~30-50ms)| Fast (~80-100ms)  
**Use case fit**|  CLI tools, serverless| Secure scripts, untrusted code  
  
Bun and Deno solve different problems. Bun optimizes for speed; Deno optimizes for security. Choose based on your primary constraint.

## Try With AI​

### Prompt 1: CLI Performance Optimization​
    
    
    I'm building an AI-powered CLI tool that developers will use frequently throughout their day.  
    Currently using Node.js, and users complain about the "startup lag."  
      
    Help me migrate to Bun:  
    1. What changes are needed in my package.json?  
    2. How do I convert my npm scripts to bun equivalents?  
    3. How do I build a standalone executable so users don't need Bun installed?  
      
    Show me the before (Node.js) and after (Bun) configurations.  
    

**What you're learning:** How to migrate existing Node.js projects to Bun for performance gains. This is practical knowledge for improving developer tools that suffer from startup latency.

### Prompt 2: Bun.serve() for AI Streaming​
    
    
    I need to build an HTTP server that streams AI responses using Server-Sent Events (SSE).  
    The server should:  
    1. Accept POST /chat with a JSON body containing a prompt  
    2. Stream the response as SSE events  
    3. Handle client disconnection gracefully  
    4. Include proper CORS headers for browser clients  
      
    Use Bun.serve() and show me the complete implementation with proper TypeScript types.  
    

**What you're learning:** How Bun's HTTP server handles streaming scenarios essential for AI applications. The pattern applies to any server that needs to stream long-running responses.

### Prompt 3: Runtime Selection Framework​
    
    
    I'm architecting an AI platform with these components:  
    1. Public API gateway (high throughput, always running)  
    2. Developer CLI (frequent cold starts, fast response expected)  
    3. Background job processor (long-running, CPU-intensive)  
    4. Admin scripts (run occasionally, handle sensitive data)  
      
    For each component, recommend Node.js, Deno, or Bun.  
    Explain the trade-offs for each decision.  
    Include specific metrics or benchmarks that support your recommendations.  
    

**What you're learning:** How to apply runtime selection criteria across a real architecture. Different components of the same system may benefit from different runtimes—understanding when to use each is a senior engineering skill.

**Safety note:** Bun's npm compatibility is approximately 99%, but some packages with native bindings or Node.js-specific internals may not work. Before migrating production code, test your full dependency tree with `bun install` and `bun test`. Keep Node.js as a fallback until you've verified compatibility.
