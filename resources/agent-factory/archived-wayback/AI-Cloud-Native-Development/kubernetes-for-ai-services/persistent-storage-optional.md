Your FastAPI agent runs in a Pod on Kubernetes. But Pods are ephemeral—when they restart, their filesystem disappears. This is a critical problem: Your agent has embedded vector search indexes, model checkpoints, conversation logs. When the Pod crashes and Kubernetes creates a replacement, all that data is gone.

**PersistentVolumes (PVs)** and **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)** solve this by decoupling storage from compute. Storage exists independent of Pods. When a Pod restarts, it reconnects to the same storage and your agent resumes with all previous state intact.

This lesson teaches you to provision persistent storage manually, understand the abstraction that makes Kubernetes storage work, and configure your Pods to use that storage reliably.

* * *

## The Problem: Data Loss on Pod Restart​

Let's see what happens without persistent storage.

Create a simple Pod that writes data to its local filesystem:
    
    
    apiVersion: v1  
    kind: Pod  
    metadata:  
      name: ephemeral-app  
    spec:  
      containers:  
      - name: app  
        image: busybox:1.28  
        command: ['sh']  
        args: ['-c', 'echo "Agent state data" > /app/state.txt; sleep 3600']  
        volumeMounts:  
        - name: app-storage  
          mountPath: /app  
      volumes:  
      - name: app-storage  
        emptyDir: {}  
    

Create this Pod:
    
    
    kubectl apply -f ephemeral-app.yaml  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    pod/ephemeral-app created  
    

Check that the file exists inside the Pod:
    
    
    kubectl exec ephemeral-app -- cat /app/state.txt  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    Agent state data  
    

Now delete the Pod:
    
    
    kubectl delete pod ephemeral-app  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    pod "ephemeral-app" deleted  
    

The data is gone forever. `emptyDir` (temporary storage) is cleared when the Pod terminates. For embeddings, model weights, and conversation history, you need storage that survives Pod restarts.

* * *

## The PV/PVC Abstraction: Separation of Concerns​

Kubernetes separates storage concerns into two layers:

**PersistentVolume (PV)** : The infrastructure—a chunk of storage that exists in your cluster. A cluster administrator provisions PVs from available storage (local disk, network storage, cloud volumes). PVs are cluster-level resources.

**PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** : The request—a developer specifies "I need 10GB of storage with read-write access." Kubernetes finds a matching PV and binds them together. PVCs are namespace-scoped.

This abstraction parallels the CPU/memory model:

  * **Node** (infrastructure) vs **Pod** (consumer request)
  * **PersistentVolume** (infrastructure) vs **PersistentVolumeClaim** (consumer request)


Think of it like renting office space:

  * **Building owner** (cluster admin) provides physical office spaces (PVs)
  * **Company manager** (developer) requests an office from the building (PVC)
  * **Company** (Pod) uses the office while it exists


When the company moves to a different office building (Pod restarts), the same office (PV) still exists. A new company can occupy it, or the same company can return to the same office after relocation.

* * *

## Creating a Static PersistentVolume​

Let's create a PV manually. We'll use `hostPath`—storage backed by a directory on the Kubernetes node. This is suitable for learning and single-node clusters like Docker Desktop Kubernetes.

First, create a directory for storage (Docker Desktop mounts your local filesystem):
    
    
    mkdir -p /tmp/k8s-data  
    echo "stored data" > /tmp/k8s-data/test.txt  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    # Directory created with test file  
    

Now create a PersistentVolume that points to that directory:
    
    
    apiVersion: v1  
    kind: PersistentVolume  
    metadata:  
      name: agent-storage-pv  
    spec:  
      capacity:  
        storage: 10Gi  
      accessModes:  
        - ReadWriteOnce  
      hostPath:  
        path: /tmp/k8s-data  
    

Apply this manifest:
    
    
    kubectl apply -f pv.yaml  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    persistentvolume/agent-storage-pv created  
    

Check that the PV was created:
    
    
    kubectl get pv  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    NAME                CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS      CLAIM   STORAGECLASS   REASON   AGE  
    agent-storage-pv    10Gi       RWO            Delete           Available            manual         <none>   7s  
    

Notice the **STATUS: Available**. The PV exists but is not yet bound to any PVC. The **RECLAIM POLICY: Delete** means that when a PVC is deleted, this PV will be deleted too (other options: Retain, Recycle).

* * *

## Claiming Storage with PersistentVolumeClaim​

A PVC is a request for storage. Create a PVC that claims the PV we just created:
    
    
    apiVersion: v1  
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim  
    metadata:  
      name: agent-storage-claim  
    spec:  
      accessModes:  
        - ReadWriteOnce  
      resources:  
        requests:  
          storage: 5Gi  
    

Apply this manifest:
    
    
    kubectl apply -f pvc.yaml  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    persistentvolumeclaim/agent-storage-claim created  
    

Check that the PVC was created and is bound:
    
    
    kubectl get pvc  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    NAME                    STATUS   VOLUME              CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE  
    agent-storage-claim     Bound    agent-storage-pv    10Gi       RWO            manual         3s  
    

Check the PV status again:
    
    
    kubectl get pv  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    NAME                CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS   CLAIM                         STORAGECLASS   REASON   AGE  
    agent-storage-pv    10Gi       RWO            Delete           Bound    default/agent-storage-claim   manual          <none>   47s  
    

The PV is now **Bound** to the PVC. They're connected. The binding was automatic based on:

  * AccessModes match (both RWO)
  * Requested storage (5Gi) is less than available (10Gi)
  * No StorageClass specified (defaults to "manual")


Now create a Pod that mounts this PVC:
    
    
    apiVersion: v1  
    kind: Pod  
    metadata:  
      name: agent-with-storage  
    spec:  
      containers:  
      - name: agent  
        image: busybox:1.28  
        command: ['sh']  
        args: ['-c', 'cat /agent-data/test.txt && sleep 3600']  
        volumeMounts:  
        - name: persistent-storage  
          mountPath: /agent-data  
      volumes:  
      - name: persistent-storage  
        persistentVolumeClaim:  
          claimName: agent-storage-claim  
    

Apply this manifest:
    
    
    kubectl apply -f agent-pod.yaml  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    pod/agent-with-storage created  
    

Check the logs to confirm the Pod mounted the storage successfully:
    
    
    kubectl logs agent-with-storage  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    stored data  
    

The Pod successfully read the file we created in `/tmp/k8s-data/test.txt` earlier. The storage persists across container restarts because it's backed by the host filesystem, not the container's ephemeral layer.

Delete the Pod and recreate it:
    
    
    kubectl delete pod agent-with-storage  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    pod "agent-with-storage" deleted  
    
    
    
    kubectl apply -f agent-pod.yaml  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    pod/agent-with-storage created  
    

Check the logs again:
    
    
    kubectl logs agent-with-storage  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    stored data  
    

The data is still there. The storage survived the Pod deletion and recreation. This is the core benefit of PersistentVolumes: **data outlives container instances**.

* * *

## Dynamic Provisioning with StorageClass​

Creating PVs manually doesn't scale. In production, you use **StorageClasses** to provision PVs dynamically.

A StorageClass defines:

  * **Provisioner** : The component that creates storage (e.g., `docker.io/hostpath` for Docker Desktop, AWS EBS provisioner for AWS)
  * **Parameters** : Storage configuration (IOPS, encryption, filesystem type, etc.)
  * **Reclaim Policy** : What happens to storage when the PVC is deleted


First, check what StorageClasses are available in your cluster:
    
    
    kubectl get storageclass  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    NAME                 PROVISIONER                   RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE  
    hostpath (default)   docker.io/hostpath            Delete          Immediate              false                  2h  
    

Docker Desktop comes with a default StorageClass. Now create a PVC that uses this StorageClass (no PV needed—it's created automatically):
    
    
    apiVersion: v1  
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim  
    metadata:  
      name: dynamic-storage-claim  
    spec:  
      storageClassName: standard  
      accessModes:  
        - ReadWriteOnce  
      resources:  
        requests:  
          storage: 2Gi  
    

Apply this manifest:
    
    
    kubectl apply -f dynamic-pvc.yaml  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    persistentvolumeclaim/dynamic-storage-claim created  
    

Check the PVC:
    
    
    kubectl get pvc  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    NAME                      STATUS   VOLUME                                    CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE  
    agent-storage-claim       Bound    agent-storage-pv                          10Gi       RWO            manual         5m  
    dynamic-storage-claim     Bound    pvc-4a2b1c9d-8f3e-4b5a-9c2d-7e6f5a4b3c   2Gi        RWO            standard       2s  
    

**Automatic PV creation** : Kubernetes provisioner created a PV automatically and bound the PVC to it. Notice the PV name is generated (`pvc-4a2b1c9d...`). You don't need to manually create PVs anymore.

Create a Pod using this dynamically-provisioned PVC:
    
    
    apiVersion: v1  
    kind: Pod  
    metadata:  
      name: dynamic-storage-pod  
    spec:  
      containers:  
      - name: app  
        image: busybox:1.28  
        command: ['sh']  
        args: ['-c', 'echo "Dynamic storage test" > /data/test.txt && cat /data/test.txt && sleep 3600']  
        volumeMounts:  
        - name: dynamic-vol  
          mountPath: /data  
      volumes:  
      - name: dynamic-vol  
        persistentVolumeClaim:  
          claimName: dynamic-storage-claim  
    

Apply and check logs:
    
    
    kubectl apply -f dynamic-pod.yaml  
    kubectl logs dynamic-storage-pod  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    Dynamic storage test  
    

Dynamic provisioning eliminates manual PV management. Developers just declare PVCs with desired storage size and access mode; the provisioner handles infrastructure provisioning.

* * *

## Access Modes: Who Can Access Storage How?​

PersistentVolumes support three access modes:

**ReadWriteOnce (RWO)** : The volume can be mounted as read-write by a **single Pod** (but that Pod's containers can all read and write). Most restrictive mode.

  * Use for: Databases, stateful applications that require single writer
  * Example: PostgreSQL pod


    
    
    accessModes:  
      - ReadWriteOnce  
    

**ReadOnlyMany (ROX)** : The volume can be mounted as **read-only by many Pods**. Multiple readers, no writers allowed.

  * Use for: Shared configuration, reference data, model weights distributed to many inference Pods
  * Example: Vector embeddings used by 100 inference Pods


    
    
    accessModes:  
      - ReadOnlyMany  
    

**ReadWriteMany (RWX)** : The volume can be mounted as read-write by **many Pods simultaneously**. Requires network storage (not hostPath).

  * Use for: Shared logs, distributed training, collaborative applications
  * Example: Training data accessed by multiple training pods simultaneously
  * Requires: Network filesystem (NFS, SMB) not available in Docker Desktop by default


    
    
    accessModes:  
      - ReadWriteMany  
    

Create a read-only PVC for agent embeddings:
    
    
    apiVersion: v1  
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim  
    metadata:  
      name: embeddings-ro-claim  
    spec:  
      storageClassName: standard  
      accessModes:  
        - ReadOnlyMany  
      resources:  
        requests:  
          storage: 5Gi  
    

This PVC can be mounted by multiple inference Pods. If one embedding update Pod writes to it, the read-only mounting enforces that other Pods cannot accidentally overwrite data.

* * *

## Reclaim Policies: What Happens When a PVC Deletes?​

When you delete a PVC, what happens to the underlying PV? The reclaim policy controls this:

**Delete** : The PV is deleted when the PVC is deleted. Storage is freed immediately. Suitable for dynamic provisioning where storage is cheap.
    
    
    reclaimPolicy: Delete  
    

**Retain** : The PV persists after PVC deletion. A cluster admin must manually delete the PV or recycle it. Suitable for important data where you want manual verification before deletion.
    
    
    reclaimPolicy: Retain  
    

**Recycle** (deprecated): The PV is wiped and made available for reuse. Avoided in production due to data security concerns.

* * *

## Putting It Together: Agent with Persistent Embeddings​

Here's a realistic Pod configuration for an agent that stores embeddings and checkpoints:
    
    
    apiVersion: v1  
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim  
    metadata:  
      name: agent-embeddings-claim  
    spec:  
      storageClassName: standard  
      accessModes:  
        - ReadWriteOnce  
      resources:  
        requests:  
          storage: 50Gi  # Space for embeddings and checkpoints  
    ---  
    apiVersion: v1  
    kind: Pod  
    metadata:  
      name: vector-agent  
    spec:  
      containers:  
      - name: agent  
        image: my-agent:v1  
        env:  
        - name: EMBEDDINGS_PATH  
          value: /agent-storage/embeddings  
        - name: CHECKPOINTS_PATH  
          value: /agent-storage/checkpoints  
        volumeMounts:  
        - name: agent-storage  
          mountPath: /agent-storage  
        resources:  
          requests:  
            memory: "2Gi"  
            cpu: "500m"  
          limits:  
            memory: "4Gi"  
            cpu: "2"  
      volumes:  
      - name: agent-storage  
        persistentVolumeClaim:  
          claimName: agent-embeddings-claim  
    

When this Pod runs:

  1. The PVC claims storage from the StorageClass
  2. Kubernetes provisions a PV automatically
  3. The Pod mounts the PV at `/agent-storage`
  4. The agent writes embeddings and checkpoints to `/agent-storage/embeddings` and `/agent-storage/checkpoints`
  5. If the Pod restarts, it reconnects to the same storage
  6. All embeddings and checkpoints survive the restart


Your agent continues serving requests without recomputing embeddings from scratch.

## Try With AI​

**Setup** : You're designing persistent storage for a multi-agent system. One agent computes and caches vector embeddings. Five other agents need read-only access to those embeddings. A background service periodically updates the embeddings.

**Challenge Prompts** :

Ask AI: "Design a PVC and access mode strategy for this scenario:

  * 1 embedding generator Pod writes embeddings weekly
  * 5 inference Pods read those embeddings continuously
  * I want to ensure inference Pods can't accidentally overwrite embeddings
  * I want minimal disk space wastage


What access modes and binding strategy should I use? Should the embeddings and generators use separate PVCs?"

Follow up: "The embedding generator needs to update embeddings without downtime. My inference Pods must continue serving. What reclaim policy and update strategy would work best? Should I use ReadOnlyMany or a different approach?"

Then: "Write a Kubernetes manifest for this architecture. Include the PVC for embeddings, the PVC for the generator (if separate), and Pod definitions for one inference Pod and the generator Pod. Ensure the inference Pod includes volume mounts for the embeddings."

**What to evaluate** :

  * Does the design isolate read-only and read-write storage?
  * Are access modes correctly matched to each component's needs?
  * Would this architecture actually prevent accidental overwrites?
  * How would the embeddings update without breaking inference Pods?


Compare your initial understanding of the access modes to what emerged through the conversation. What trade-offs between storage isolation, update frequency, and complexity did you discover?
