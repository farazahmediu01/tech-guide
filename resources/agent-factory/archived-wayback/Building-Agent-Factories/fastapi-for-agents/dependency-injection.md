Every endpoint in your API needs shared resources: configuration, connections, services. You could create these inside each function, but that's repetitive and makes testing hard. Dependency injection solves this—FastAPI creates what your endpoint needs and passes it in.

This pattern powers everything in the rest of this chapter. Settings, database sessions, authentication—all use `Depends()`.

## The Problem: Repeated Setup​

Without dependency injection:
    
    
    @app.get("/tasks")  
    def list_tasks():  
        # Setup code repeated in EVERY endpoint  
        config = load_config_from_env()  
        logger = setup_logger("tasks")  
        return {"config": config.app_name}  
      
    @app.get("/users")  
    def list_users():  
        # Same setup, repeated again  
        config = load_config_from_env()  
        logger = setup_logger("users")  
        return {"config": config.app_name}  
    

Problems:

  * Same code in every function
  * Hard to test (can't swap config for test config)
  * If setup logic changes, you update everywhere


## The Solution: Depends()​

With dependency injection:
    
    
    from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends  
      
    app = FastAPI()  
      
      
    def get_config():  
        """Provide configuration to endpoints."""  
        return {"app_name": "Task API", "version": "1.0"}  
      
      
    @app.get("/tasks")  
    def list_tasks(config: dict = Depends(get_config)):  
        return {"app": config["app_name"]}  
      
      
    @app.get("/users")  
    def list_users(config: dict = Depends(get_config)):  
        return {"app": config["app_name"]}  
    

FastAPI:

  1. Sees `Depends(get_config)`
  2. Calls `get_config()` automatically
  3. Passes the result to your function


**Output:**
    
    
    {"app": "Task API"}  
    

## A Dependency Is Just a Function​

Any callable works as a dependency:
    
    
    def get_request_id() -> str:  
        """Generate unique ID for this request."""  
        import uuid  
        return str(uuid.uuid4())  
      
      
    @app.get("/debug")  
    def debug_info(request_id: str = Depends(get_request_id)):  
        return {"request_id": request_id}  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    {"request_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"}  
    

Each request gets a new UUID. The dependency runs fresh for every request.

## Caching with lru_cache​

Some dependencies are expensive—reading config files, creating connections. You want them created once, not per-request:
    
    
    from functools import lru_cache  
      
      
    @lru_cache  
    def get_settings():  
        """Load settings once, reuse forever."""  
        print("Loading settings...")  # Only prints once!  
        return {  
            "app_name": "Task API",  
            "debug": True  
        }  
      
      
    @app.get("/info")  
    def app_info(settings: dict = Depends(get_settings)):  
        return {"app": settings["app_name"]}  
    

Call `/info` ten times—you'll see "Loading settings..." printed only once.

**When to use`@lru_cache`:**

  * Configuration that doesn't change
  * Expensive initialization (parsing files, creating clients)
  * Anything you'd normally put in a global variable


## Yield Dependencies for Cleanup​

Some resources need cleanup—file handles, connections, temporary files. Use `yield` instead of `return`:
    
    
    def get_temp_file():  
        """Provide a temporary file that gets cleaned up."""  
        import tempfile  
        import os  
      
        # Setup: create the file  
        fd, path = tempfile.mkstemp()  
        file = os.fdopen(fd, 'w')  
      
        try:  
            yield file  # Provide to endpoint  
        finally:  
            # Cleanup: runs after endpoint completes  
            file.close()  
            os.unlink(path)  
      
      
    @app.post("/upload")  
    def process_upload(temp: file = Depends(get_temp_file)):  
        temp.write("data")  
        return {"status": "processed"}  
    

The `finally` block runs after your endpoint finishes—even if it raises an exception. This is how database sessions will work in later lessons.

## Complete Example: Request Logger​

Here's a practical dependency that logs every request:
    
    
    from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, Request  
    from datetime import datetime  
      
    app = FastAPI()  
      
      
    def get_request_logger(request: Request):  
        """Log request details and provide logger to endpoint."""  
        start = datetime.now()  
        method = request.method  
        path = request.url.path  
      
        print(f"[{start}] {method} {path} - started")  
      
        yield {"method": method, "path": path, "start": start}  
      
        end = datetime.now()  
        duration = (end - start).total_seconds()  
        print(f"[{end}] {method} {path} - completed in {duration:.3f}s")  
      
      
    @app.get("/tasks")  
    def list_tasks(log: dict = Depends(get_request_logger)):  
        return {"tasks": [], "logged_path": log["path"]}  
      
      
    @app.post("/tasks")  
    def create_task(log: dict = Depends(get_request_logger)):  
        return {"id": 1, "logged_method": log["method"]}  
    

**Console output:**
    
    
    [2024-01-15 10:30:00] GET /tasks - started  
    [2024-01-15 10:30:00] GET /tasks - completed in 0.002s  
    

Notice how `Request` is also injected—FastAPI provides it automatically.

## Why This Matters​

In the next lessons, you'll use `Depends()` for:

Lesson| Dependency| Purpose  
---|---|---  
Environment Variables| `get_settings()`| Configuration from .env  
SQLModel| `get_session()`| Database connection  
Authentication| `get_current_user()`| Verify JWT tokens  
  
Understanding `Depends()` now means these patterns will make sense immediately.

## Hands-On Exercise​

Build a simple API with dependencies:

**Step 1:** Create the app with a config dependency:
    
    
    from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends  
    from functools import lru_cache  
      
    app = FastAPI()  
      
      
    @lru_cache  
    def get_config():  
        return {  
            "app_name": "My API",  
            "max_items": 100,  
            "debug": True  
        }  
      
      
    @app.get("/config")  
    def show_config(config: dict = Depends(get_config)):  
        return config  
    

**Step 2:** Add a request counter (using a class for state):
    
    
    class RequestCounter:  
        def __init__(self):  
            self.count = 0  
      
        def increment(self) -> int:  
            self.count += 1  
            return self.count  
      
      
    counter = RequestCounter()  
      
      
    def get_request_count() -> int:  
        return counter.increment()  
      
      
    @app.get("/count")  
    def show_count(count: int = Depends(get_request_count)):  
        return {"request_number": count}  
    

**Step 3:** Test it:
    
    
    # First request  
    curl http://localhost:8000/count  
    # {"request_number": 1}  
      
    # Second request  
    curl http://localhost:8000/count  
    # {"request_number": 2}  
    

## Common Mistakes​

**Mistake 1:** Calling the function instead of passing it
    
    
    # Wrong - function called at import time!  
    @app.get("/tasks")  
    def list_tasks(config = Depends(get_config())):  # () is wrong!  
        ...  
      
    # Correct - pass the function itself  
    @app.get("/tasks")  
    def list_tasks(config = Depends(get_config)):  # No ()  
        ...  
    

**Mistake 2:** Forgetting to yield in cleanup dependencies
    
    
    # Wrong - return doesn't allow cleanup code  
    def get_file():  
        f = open("data.txt")  
        return f  # File never closed!  
      
    # Correct - yield allows cleanup  
    def get_file():  
        f = open("data.txt")  
        try:  
            yield f  
        finally:  
            f.close()  
    

**Mistake 3:** Caching things that should be fresh
    
    
    # Wrong - request ID should be different each time!  
    @lru_cache  
    def get_request_id():  
        return str(uuid.uuid4())  
      
    # Correct - no cache for per-request values  
    def get_request_id():  
        return str(uuid.uuid4())  
    

## Try With AI​

After completing the exercise, explore these patterns.

**Prompt 1: Dependency Chains**
    
    
    I have a config dependency and want to create a logger dependency  
    that uses the config. How do dependencies depend on other dependencies?  
    Show me how to chain get_logger(config = Depends(get_config)).  
    

**What you're learning:** Dependencies can depend on other dependencies. FastAPI resolves the chain automatically.

**Prompt 2: Testing Dependencies**
    
    
    I want to test my endpoints without using the real config.  
    How do I override a dependency in tests? Show me  
    app.dependency_overrides and how to use it.  
    

**What you're learning:** The power of DI is testability. Override any dependency with a mock for testing.

**Prompt 3: Class Dependencies**
    
    
    Instead of functions, can I use a class as a dependency?  
    I want TaskService with methods like list() and create().  
    Show me how Depends() works with classes.  
    

**What you're learning:** Classes with `__init__` parameters work as dependencies. FastAPI resolves the constructor parameters.

## Reflect on Your Skill​

You built a `fastapi-agent` skill in Lesson 0. Test and improve it based on what you learned.

### Test Your Skill​
    
    
    Using my fastapi-agent skill, help me organize code with dependencies.  
    Does my skill include Depends() patterns, caching, and yield for cleanup?  
    

### Identify Gaps​

Ask yourself:

  * Did my skill include creating custom dependency functions with Depends()?
  * Did it explain when to use lru_cache vs fresh per-request?
  * Did it cover yield dependencies for resource cleanup?


### Improve Your Skill​

If you found gaps:
    
    
    My fastapi-agent skill is missing dependency injection basics.  
    Update it to include Depends() pattern, lru_cache for configuration,  
    and yield dependencies for cleanup.
