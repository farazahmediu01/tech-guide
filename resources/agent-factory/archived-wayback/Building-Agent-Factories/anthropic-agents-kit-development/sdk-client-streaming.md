You've mastered the basic `query()` pattern. It solves one-shot problems well: "Find and fix the bug." "Explain this code." Done.

But what if you need **ongoing collaboration**? Not one question. Not a fixed sequence. A genuine conversation where Claude remembers what you said, builds on prior context, and refines outputs iteratively.

That's what ClaudeSDKClient provides: **multi-turn conversation with session persistence**.

And beyond that lies an even more powerful pattern: **streaming input**. Instead of sending a complete prompt at once, you feed messages into the agent as a generator—enabling dynamic composition, image insertion, and real-time feedback loops.

## From Query to Conversation​

Let's clarify the fundamental difference between what you've learned and what you're learning now.

### Query Pattern (Single-Turn)​
    
    
    async for msg in query(  
        prompt="What's the capital of France?",  
        options=ClaudeAgentOptions(...)  
    ):  
        if hasattr(msg, "result"):  
            print(msg.result)  # "Paris"  
    

Query is:

  * **Stateless** : Each call is independent
  * **Simple** : One prompt in, one response out
  * **Fast** : Minimal overhead


This pattern works for autonomous tasks: "Find bugs in this file." "Refactor this function." The agent doesn't need to remember previous conversations because there is no previous conversation.

### ClaudeSDKClient Pattern (Multi-Turn)​
    
    
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options) as client:  
        # First turn  
        await client.query("What's the capital of France?")  
        async for msg in client.receive_response():  
            print(msg)  # "Paris"  
      
        # Second turn - Claude remembers context  
        await client.query("What's the population of that city?")  
        async for msg in client.receive_response():  
            print(msg)  # "About 2.1 million..."  
      
        # Third turn - Claude knows "that city" = Paris  
        await client.query("When was it founded?")  
        async for msg in client.receive_response():  
            print(msg)  # "Dating back to around 250 BC..."  
    

ClaudeSDKClient is:

  * **Stateful** : Conversation context persists across turns
  * **Conversational** : Back-and-forth dialogue with context accumulation
  * **Interactive** : Ideal for iterative refinement and collaborative workflows


### Decision Framework: When to Use Each​

Pattern| Use When| Example  
---|---|---  
**query()**|  Autonomous one-shot tasks| "Find bugs in auth.py"  
**query()**|  Predictable, repeatable workflows| Batch processing, pipeline stages  
**ClaudeSDKClient**|  Conversational refinement| User iterating on requirements  
**ClaudeSDKClient**|  Long-running interactive sessions| Chatbots, code review collaboration  
**ClaudeSDKClient**|  Context-dependent follow-ups| "What's the risk of that approach?"  
  
## Architecture: How ClaudeSDKClient Differs​

When you use `query()`, each invocation is isolated:
    
    
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐  
    │ Query 1: "Analyze auth.py"              │  
    │ - Fresh agent instance                  │  
    │ - No memory of previous work            │  
    │ - Agent completes, session ends         │  
    └─────────────────────────────────────────┘  
      
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐  
    │ Query 2: "Review database schema"       │  
    │ - Completely new session                │  
    │ - Agent cannot reference Query 1        │  
    │ - No continuity between tasks           │  
    └─────────────────────────────────────────┘  
    

ClaudeSDKClient maintains a **persistent conversation context** :
    
    
    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐  
    │  ClaudeSDKClient Session (Persistent)            │  
    │                                                  │  
    │  Turn 1: "Analyze auth.py"                      │  
    │  ↓ Response + Context Stored                    │  
    │  Turn 2: "What security risks did you find?"    │  
    │  ↓ Claude reads Turn 1 response, continues      │  
    │  Turn 3: "Fix those risks"                      │  
    │  ↓ Claude knows exact risks from Turn 2         │  
    │                                                  │  
    │  All turns share accumulated context →          │  
    │  No information loss between messages           │  
    └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  
    

This is critical for:

  * **Iterative refinement** : Each turn improves on prior context
  * **Constraint accumulation** : Adding requirements progressively
  * **Error recovery** : "That approach won't work because [context]. Try this instead."


## Building Multi-Turn Conversations​

### Basic Pattern: The Conversation Loop​
    
    
    from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient, ClaudeAgentOptions  
      
    async def build_specification_collaboratively():  
        """Agent and human iterate to refine requirements."""  
      
        options = ClaudeAgentOptions(  
            allowed_tools=["Read", "Bash"],  
            permission_mode="acceptEdits"  
        )  
      
        async with ClaudeSDKClient(options) as client:  
            # Turn 1: Initial requirements  
            await client.query("""  
            I'm building a user authentication system.  
            Initial requirements:  
            - Email/password login  
            - Session management  
            - Password reset via email  
      
            What security patterns should I follow?  
            """)  
      
            async for msg in client.receive_response():  
                print(msg)  
      
            # Turn 2: Claude's response is stored. Add constraint.  
            await client.query("""  
            Good suggestions. We also need to support OAuth2 (Google, GitHub).  
            How does OAuth2 integration change the architecture?  
            """)  
      
            async for msg in client.receive_response():  
                print(msg)  
      
            # Turn 3: Claude remembers both prior requirements AND OAuth2  
            await client.query("""  
            Understood. Now walk me through the database schema for this system.  
            What tables do we need? What are foreign key relationships?  
            """)  
      
            async for msg in client.receive_response():  
                print(msg)  
    

**Key observation** : Turn 3 query never mentions email, passwords, or OAuth2. Claude knows these from prior context. You only specify the NEW question.

This is **specification accumulation** —each turn adds one constraint, and Claude maintains the growing specification across all turns.

### Pattern: Interrupts for Long-Running Operations​

What if Claude's analysis is taking too long, or you need to stop and resume later?
    
    
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options) as client:  
        await client.query("Analyze this large codebase for performance issues...")  
      
        try:  
            async for msg in client.receive_response():  
                # Check for timeout or user interrupt  
                if should_interrupt():  # Your interrupt logic  
                    await client.interrupt()  # Stop gracefully  
                    break  
                print(msg)  
        except InterruptedError:  
            print("Agent interrupted by user")  
            # Session persists - you can resume later  
    

The session remains open. You can:

  1. Pause analysis with `interrupt()`
  2. Make different query without losing context
  3. Resume from where you left off


## Streaming Input: Dynamic Message Composition​

So far, you've passed complete prompts to `query()` or `ClaudeSDKClient.query()`. But what if your input is **dynamic**? What if you're:

  * Reading files and building prompts on-the-fly
  * Inserting images at specific points
  * Streaming user feedback in real-time


That's where **message generators** come in.

### The Generator Pattern​

Instead of:
    
    
    prompt = "Static string"  
    await client.query(prompt)  
    

You can:
    
    
    async def message_generator():  
        # Dynamically produce message parts  
        yield first_part  
        yield second_part  
        yield third_part  
      
    await client.query(prompt=message_generator())  
    

Each `yield` sends a message part to Claude as streaming input.

### Example: Building Complex Analysis Requests​

Imagine you're analyzing a codebase for refactoring opportunities. You want to:

  1. Send the specification
  2. Send the current code
  3. Send performance metrics
  4. Ask Claude to synthesize recommendations


    
    
    async def analyze_refactoring_request():  
        """Generate multi-part analysis request by reading files."""  
      
        # Part 1: Specification  
        spec_content = open("spec.md").read()  
        yield {  
            "type": "user",  
            "message": {  
                "role": "user",  
                "content": f"## Current Specification\n\n{spec_content}"  
            }  
        }  
      
        # Part 2: Source code  
        code_content = open("src/main.py").read()  
        yield {  
            "type": "user",  
            "message": {  
                "role": "user",  
                "content": f"## Source Code\n\n```python\n{code_content}\n```"  
            }  
        }  
      
        # Part 3: Performance metrics  
        metrics = open("metrics.json").read()  
        yield {  
            "type": "user",  
            "message": {  
                "role": "user",  
                "content": f"## Performance Profile\n\n{metrics}"  
            }  
        }  
      
        # Part 4: The actual question  
        yield {  
            "type": "user",  
            "message": {  
                "role": "user",  
                "content": """  
                Based on the specification, code, and performance metrics:  
                1. What refactorings would most improve performance?  
                2. How would each refactoring change the code structure?  
                3. What risks should I be aware of?  
                """  
            }  
        }  
      
    # Execute the streaming request  
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options) as client:  
        async for msg in client.query(prompt=analyze_refactoring_request()):  
            print(msg)  
    

**Key insight** : Each `yield` is a separate message part. Claude reads them all before responding, but YOU control the composition dynamically. If a file is too large, you can truncate it. If a metric changes, you regenerate it. The generator pattern gives you programmatic control over request assembly.

### Streaming Input with Images​

One of the most powerful uses of streaming input: inserting images at specific points in your analysis.
    
    
    async def analyze_ui_screenshot():  
        """Analyze screenshot with contextual code."""  
      
        yield {  
            "type": "user",  
            "message": {  
                "role": "user",  
                "content": "## Current UI Implementation\n\nHere's the screenshot:"  
            }  
        }  
      
        # Insert image from file  
        with open("screenshot.png", "rb") as f:  
            image_data = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode()  
      
        yield {  
            "type": "user",  
            "message": {  
                "role": "user",  
                "content": [  
                    {  
                        "type": "image",  
                        "source": {  
                            "type": "base64",  
                            "media_type": "image/png",  
                            "data": image_data  
                        }  
                    },  
                    {  
                        "type": "text",  
                        "text": "And here's the React component:"  
                    }  
                ]  
            }  
        }  
      
        # Add the code  
        code = open("Button.tsx").read()  
        yield {  
            "type": "user",  
            "message": {  
                "role": "user",  
                "content": f"```tsx\n{code}\n```\n\nAnalyze: Does the UI match the implementation? What mismatches do you see?"  
            }  
        }  
      
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options) as client:  
        async for msg in client.query(prompt=analyze_ui_screenshot()):  
            print(msg)  
    

This is how you build **visual code review agents** that compare screenshots to implementations, or **UI testing agents** that analyze pixel-level changes.

## Comparing the Three Patterns​

Pattern| Structure| Use Case| Example  
---|---|---|---  
**query(prompt="text")**|  Static string → Single response| One-shot autonomous work| "Find bugs in auth.py"  
**ClaudeSDKClient.query("text")**|  Multi-turn dialogue within session| Iterative refinement| "Analyze... What risks?... Fix those."  
**query(prompt=generator())**|  Dynamically composed streaming input| Complex multi-part requests| Read files → build request → analyze  
  
**Decision Matrix** :

  * Do you need **multiple back-and-forth turns**? → `ClaudeSDKClient`
  * Is your **input dynamically generated** (reading files, inserting images)? → Generator pattern
  * Is this a **simple one-shot task**? → Basic `query(prompt="text")`


## Practical Patterns for Production Agents​

### Pattern 1: Iterative Code Review Collaboration​
    
    
    async def code_review_session(repo_path):  
        """Ongoing code review where reviewer and developer iterate."""  
      
        options = ClaudeAgentOptions(  
            allowed_tools=["Read", "Bash", "Grep"],  
            permission_mode="default"  
        )  
      
        async with ClaudeSDKClient(options) as client:  
            # Initial review  
            code = open(f"{repo_path}/api.py").read()  
            await client.query(f"Review this API code for security and performance:\n\n```python\n{code}\n```")  
      
            async for msg in client.receive_response():  
                review_feedback = str(msg)  
      
            # Developer addresses feedback  
            await client.query("I've updated the code with parameterized queries. Here's the new version: [updated code]. Did this address your security concerns?")  
      
            async for msg in client.receive_response():  
                pass  
      
            # Discussion continues with full context  
            await client.query("One more question: should we add request rate limiting?")  
      
            async for msg in client.receive_response():  
                print(msg)  
    

### Pattern 2: Requirements Refinement Conversation​
    
    
    async def refine_requirements():  
        """Specification evolves through dialogue."""  
      
        async with ClaudeSDKClient(options) as client:  
            # Turn 1: Initial idea  
            await client.query("""  
            I'm building a Digital FTE that moderates user comments.  
            Requirements:  
            - Detect offensive language  
            - Flag misinformation  
            - Consider context (is it satire? criticism vs attack?)  
            - Escalate to human if uncertain  
      
            What's missing from my requirements?  
            """)  
      
            async for msg in client.receive_response():  
                print("Claude's feedback:", msg)  
      
            # Turn 2: Claude identified gaps, now add specifics  
            await client.query("""  
            Good points about cultural context. We're starting with English-only, US-focused.  
            We'll add multi-language support later.  
      
            How should we structure the escalation system? What data should we attach to escalated comments?  
            """)  
      
            async for msg in client.receive_response():  
                print(msg)  
      
            # Turn 3: Claude understands scope, now architectural depth  
            await client.query("""  
            We're using PostgreSQL, FastAPI backend, React frontend.  
            Walk me through the data schema for this system.  
            """)  
      
            async for msg in client.receive_response():  
                print(msg)  
    

### Pattern 3: Streaming Analysis with Images and Code​
    
    
    async def analyze_ui_bug():  
        """Visual bug analysis: screenshot → code → discussion."""  
      
        async def visual_analysis_request():  
            # Show the broken UI  
            yield {  
                "type": "user",  
                "message": {  
                    "role": "user",  
                    "content": "## Reported Bug\n\nThe button appears shifted on mobile. Here's the screenshot:"  
                }  
            }  
      
            # Insert screenshot (base64 or file)  
            with open("bug-screenshot.png", "rb") as f:  
                screenshot_data = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode()  
      
            yield {  
                "type": "user",  
                "message": {  
                    "role": "user",  
                    "content": [  
                        {  
                            "type": "image",  
                            "source": {  
                                "type": "base64",  
                                "media_type": "image/png",  
                                "data": screenshot_data  
                            }  
                        }  
                    ]  
                }  
            }  
      
            # Show the component code

## When to Use Streaming vs ClaudeSDKClient vs Query​

**Choose query() if:**

  * Task is autonomous (agent doesn't need to ask questions)
  * Input is fixed and complete at call time
  * No conversation needed


**Choose ClaudeSDKClient if:**

  * You need back-and-forth dialogue
  * Context from earlier turns informs later turns
  * Workflow is inherently interactive


**Choose streaming generator if:**

  * Input is dynamically composed (reading files)
  * You're inserting images at specific points
  * You need programmatic control over request assembly


**Combine streaming + ClaudeSDKClient if:**

  * First turn uses streaming input (complex multi-part request)
  * Following turns use context from first turn
  * Interactive refinement of initial complex request


Example:
    
    
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options) as client:  
        # Turn 1: Streaming input (multiple files + question)  
        async for msg in client.query(prompt=dynamic_analysis_generator()):  
            print(msg)  
      
        # Turn 2: Follow-up using context from Turn 1  
        await client.query("Those are good suggestions. Can you estimate the refactoring effort?")  
        async for msg in client.receive_response():  
            print(msg)  
    

This combines **complexity of input composition** (Turn 1) with **context persistence** (Turn 2).

## Try With AI​

Setup: You're building a specification assistant—a Digital FTE that helps engineers clarify vague requirements into executable specifications. The conversation should demonstrate iterative refinement where each turn reveals constraints the previous turn didn't address.

**Part 1: Initial Specification Request**

Ask Claude:
    
    
    I'm building a file storage system for a startup.  
    Users upload files, store them, download them later.  
    What are all the things I need to think about in the specification?  
    

As you read Claude's response, notice what it identifies as gaps in your initial idea: concurrency, permission, retention, file size limits, deletion, etc.

**Part 2: Constraint Addition**

Now tell Claude a constraint based on your domain:
    
    
    We're enterprise SaaS, so security is critical. We also need to support versioning—  
    users can upload a new version of a file without deleting the old one.  
      
    How does versioning change the architecture?  
    

Claude will now reference its prior analysis AND adjust for versioning. It doesn't repeat "you need permissions" because it already said that—it builds on it.

**Part 3: Schema Design**

Continue the conversation:
    
    
    Okay, now design the database schema for this system.  
    

Claude has all prior context: enterprise-grade security, versioning, permissions. It won't propose naive designs because it remembers the constraints.

**Part 4: Architectural Validation**

Ask Claude to validate the emerging design:
    
    
    In this schema, how would you handle concurrent uploads of the same file?  
    What race conditions might occur?  
    

Claude sees the schema from Part 3, remembers constraints from Parts 1-2, and analyzes concurrency from that context.

**Reflection Questions**

As you work through this conversation:

  * In Part 2, did Claude reduce verbosity because it already covered permissions? Why matters: ClaudeSDKClient isn't just about back-and-forth—it's about **progressive complexity without redundancy**.
  * In Part 3, was the schema different from what you'd get if you asked for it in isolation? Compare: Run this same schema question in a new `query()` call without prior context. Notice the difference?
  * In Part 4, did Claude's analysis reference the schema from Part 3 explicitly? That's context persistence. That's the power of multi-turn.


This entire conversation is an example of **specification accumulation** : each turn adds one requirement, and the agent builds increasingly sophisticated output that respects all prior constraints.

Now build your own: A different domain (content moderation, image processing, financial analysis). Follow this pattern: Vague requirement → Add constraint → Ask for artifact (schema/API/architecture) → Validate design. Watch how context accumulation eliminates repetition and improves output quality.

## Reflect on Your Skill​

You built a `claude-agent` skill in Lesson 0. Test and improve it based on what you learned.

### Test Your Skill​
    
    
    Using my claude-agent skill, implement a multi-turn conversation with ClaudeSDKClient.  
    Does my skill cover streaming input and message generators?  
    

### Identify Gaps​

Ask yourself:

  * Did my skill explain ClaudeSDKClient for multi-turn conversations?
  * Did it show streaming input patterns with message generators?


### Improve Your Skill​

If you found gaps:
    
    
    My claude-agent skill is missing ClaudeSDKClient patterns.  
    Update it to include:  
    - Multi-turn conversation with context preservation  
    - Message generator patterns  
    - Image insertion with streaming input
