A multi-agent system is only as reliable as its weakest error path. This chapter teaches the five disciplines of multi-agent reliability: structured error propagation, escalation calibration, context management at scale, information provenance, and human review integration. These are the patterns that separate prototype-grade systems from production-grade systems.

## What You'll Learn​

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

  * Design structured error responses with the MCP `isError` pattern and error category taxonomy
  * Implement subagent error recovery with partial results propagation and coordinator decision-making
  * Calibrate escalation triggers using explicit criteria and few-shot examples (not sentiment or confidence scores)
  * Preserve critical information across long sessions using the "case facts" pattern
  * Build claim-source mapping pipelines that maintain provenance through multi-agent synthesis
  * Design human review workflows with field-level confidence calibration and stratified sampling
  * Orchestrate coordinator-subagent architectures with parallel execution and iterative refinement


## Chapter Structure​

  1. **Structured Error Propagation — The MCP isError Pattern** — error categories (transient, validation, business, permission), structured metadata, access-failure vs valid-empty-result
  2. **Subagent Error Recovery and Coordinator Decision-Making** — local recovery first, partial results, coverage annotations in synthesis
  3. **Escalation Calibration — When to Escalate vs Resolve** — what works (explicit criteria + few-shot), what doesn't (confidence scores, sentiment, "be conservative")
  4. **Context Management at Scale** — progressive summarization risks, the "case facts" pattern, "lost in the middle" effect, scratchpad files
  5. **Information Provenance in Multi-Source Synthesis** — claim-source mappings, conflicting sources, temporal data, scoped verification tools
  6. **Human Review Workflows & Confidence Calibration** — aggregate accuracy trap, field-level scores, threshold calibration with labeled sets, stratified sampling
  7. **Coordinator-Subagent Orchestration Patterns** — hub-and-spoke, context isolation, Task tool, parallel execution, iterative refinement (Capstone)


## Running Project​

Students build a multi-agent research system (certification exam Scenario 3) with a coordinator agent, web search subagent, document analysis subagent, and synthesis subagent — progressively adding reliability engineering to each layer.
