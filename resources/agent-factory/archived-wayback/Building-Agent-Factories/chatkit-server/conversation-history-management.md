Your agent responds to user messages but treats each interaction as brand new—no memory of previous questions, no continuity between sessions. The user asks, "What was that task we discussed earlier?" and your agent replies, "I don't see any previous discussion." The conversation context exists in the database, but it never reaches the agent's prompt.

This isn't a bug in ChatKit. It's a missing step in your respond() implementation. ChatKit provides the storage API—`store.load_thread_items()`—but leaves history serialization to you. This lesson shows you how to load conversation history, format it for agent consumption, and extract the recurring pattern into a reusable skill.

By the end, you'll have built the `conversation-history` skill that transforms ChatKit's thread storage into agent memory.

## Loading Thread History from Store​

ChatKit stores every message in the thread database. The `store.load_thread_items()` method retrieves conversation history with control over ordering, pagination, and filtering.

**Method Signature** :
    
    
    from chatkit.types import Page, ThreadItem  
      
    async def load_thread_items(  
        self,  
        thread_id: str,  
        *,  
        after: str | None = None,  
        limit: int | None = None,  
        order: Literal["asc", "desc"] = "asc",  
    ) -> Page[ThreadItem]:  
    

**Parameters** :

  * `thread_id`: Conversation identifier (from `thread.id` in respond())
  * `after`: Load items after this item ID (pagination cursor)
  * `limit`: Maximum number of items to return (default: all)
  * `order`: `"asc"` (oldest first) or `"desc"` (newest first)


**Returns** : `Page[ThreadItem]` object containing `.data` (list of items) and pagination metadata

### Loading Recent History​

Most agents don't need the entire conversation history—recent context suffices. Load the last 20 messages:
    
    
    from chatkit.server import ChatKitServer  
    from chatkit.types import ThreadMetadata, UserMessageItem, ThreadItem  
    from typing import AsyncIterator, Any  
      
    class MemoryAwareServer(ChatKitServer):  
        async def respond(  
            self,  
            thread: ThreadMetadata,  
            input: UserMessageItem | None,  
            context: Any,  
        ) -> AsyncIterator[ThreadStreamEvent]:  
            # Load last 20 messages (newest first)  
            page = await self.store.load_thread_items(  
                thread.id,  
                after=None,  
                limit=20,  
                order="desc",  # Newest messages first  
                context=context,  
            )  
      
            # Extract items from Page object  
            history_items = page.data  
      
            # Reverse to chronological order (oldest → newest)  
            history_items.reverse()  
      
            # Now serialize history_items for agent...  
    

**Output** (when thread has 5 messages):
    
    
    Loaded 5 thread items from thread_abc123  
    Items in chronological order:  
      1. user: "Create a task for the demo"  
      2. assistant: "Task created: Demo preparation"  
      3. user: "What's the deadline?"  
      4. assistant: "The deadline is December 31st"  
      5. user: "Can you extend it by one week?"  
    

**Why reverse after loading?** ChatKit's `order="desc"` gives newest messages first (efficient pagination), but agents expect chronological order (oldest → newest) for conversation flow.

* * *

## Serializing History for Agent Context​

Agents consume conversation history as formatted strings in their system prompt or as message arrays. ChatKit's `ThreadItem` objects need conversion to agent-consumable format.

**ThreadItem Structure** (simplified):
    
    
    @dataclass  
    class ThreadItem:  
        id: str                    # Message identifier  
        role: Literal["user", "assistant", "tool"]  
        content: str               # Message text  
        created_at: int            # Unix timestamp  
        # ... additional fields  
    

### Building History String​

Convert `ThreadItem` list to formatted conversation:
    
    
    def serialize_history(items: list[ThreadItem]) -> str:  
        """Convert thread items to conversation history string."""  
        lines = []  
        for item in items:  
            if item.role == "user":  
                lines.append(f"User: {item.content}")  
            elif item.role == "assistant":  
                lines.append(f"Assistant: {item.content}")  
            # Skip tool messages (internal agent operations)  
      
        return "\n".join(lines)  
      
    # Usage in respond()  
    history_string = serialize_history(history_items)  
      
    # Include in agent system prompt  
    system_prompt = f"""You are a TaskManager assistant.  
      
    Previous conversation:  
    {history_string}  
      
    Current request follows. Maintain continuity with conversation history."""  
    

**Output** :
    
    
    You are a TaskManager assistant.  
      
    Previous conversation:  
    User: Create a task for the demo  
    Assistant: Task created: Demo preparation  
    User: What's the deadline?  
    Assistant: The deadline is December 31st  
    User: Can you extend it by one week?  
      
    Current request follows. Maintain continuity with conversation history.  
    

### Alternative: Message Array Format​

Some agent frameworks (like OpenAI SDK) accept message arrays:
    
    
    def serialize_to_messages(items: list[ThreadItem]) -> list[dict]:  
        """Convert thread items to message array format."""  
        messages = []  
        for item in items:  
            if item.role in ("user", "assistant"):  
                messages.append({  
                    "role": item.role,  
                    "content": item.content  
                })  
        return messages  
      
    # Usage with OpenAI SDK  
    from agents import Agent, Runner  
      
    history_messages = serialize_to_messages(history_items)  
      
    result = Runner.run_streamed(  
        agent=agent,  
        messages=[  
            *history_messages,  # Previous conversation  
            {"role": "user", "content": input.content}  # Current input  
        ]  
    )  
    

**Output** (message array):
    
    
    [  
        {"role": "user", "content": "Create a task for the demo"},  
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Task created: Demo preparation"},  
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the deadline?"},  
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The deadline is December 31st"},  
        {"role": "user", "content": "Can you extend it by one week?"}  
    ]  
    

**Choosing serialization format** : Use string format for simple agents (concatenate into system prompt), use message array for SDK-based agents (Runner.run_streamed() accepts messages parameter).

## Context Window Management Strategies​

Not all conversation history fits in the agent's context window. Long threads require pruning strategies to stay within token limits.

Strategy| When to Use| Trade-offs  
---|---|---  
**Recent Window**|  General conversations| Loses older context but maintains recent continuity  
**Token-Aware Pruning**|  Production systems| Prevents context overflow, requires token counting  
**Semantic Summarization**|  Long-running support threads| Preserves key information, adds summarization cost  
**Conversation Branching**|  Multi-topic threads| Isolates topics, requires explicit branching UI  
  
### Recent Window Strategy (Simplest)​

Load fixed number of recent messages:
    
    
    # Load last 20 messages  
    page = await self.store.load_thread_items(  
        thread.id,  
        after=None,  
        limit=20,  
        order="desc",  
        context=context,  
    )  
    history_items = page.data  
    history_items.reverse()  
    

**Pros** : Simple, predictable memory usage **Cons** : Hard cutoff may lose important context mid-conversation

### Token-Aware Pruning Strategy​

Calculate token count and truncate to model limits:
    
    
    import tiktoken  # OpenAI tokenizer  
      
    def prune_to_token_limit(  
        items: list[ThreadItem],  
        max_tokens: int = 8000  # Leave room for response  
    ) -> list[ThreadItem]:  
        """Keep most recent messages within token budget."""  
        encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4")  
      
        pruned_items = []  
        total_tokens = 0  
      
        # Process newest → oldest, keep until budget exceeded  
        for item in reversed(items):  
            item_tokens = len(encoding.encode(item.content))  
            if total_tokens + item_tokens > max_tokens:  
                break  # Stop before exceeding budget  
      
            pruned_items.insert(0, item)  # Maintain chronological order  
            total_tokens += item_tokens  
      
        return pruned_items  
      
    # Usage  
    page = await self.store.load_thread_items(  
        thread.id,  
        after=None,  
        order="desc",  
        context=context,  
    )  
    history_items = prune_to_token_limit(page.data, max_tokens=8000)  
    

**Output** (with 15,000 token conversation):
    
    
    Original: 42 messages (15,247 tokens)  
    Pruned: 28 messages (7,983 tokens)  
    Removed 14 oldest messages to fit context window  
    

**When to use** : Production systems where context overflow causes failures. Requires `tiktoken` library (`uv add tiktoken`).

## Integrating History into Agent Workflow​

With the skill created, apply it to your ChatKit server:
    
    
    from chatkit.server import ChatKitServer  
    from chatkit.agents import stream_agent_response  
    from agents import Agent, Runner  
      
    class TaskManagerServer(ChatKitServer):  
        async def respond(self, thread, input, context):  
            # STEP 1: Load conversation history (conversation-history skill)  
            page = await self.store.load_thread_items(  
                thread.id,  
                after=None,  
                limit=20,  
                order="desc",  
                context=context,  
            )  
            history_items = page.data  
            history_items.reverse()  
      
            # STEP 2: Serialize to message array format  
            history_messages = [  
                {"role": item.role, "content": item.content}  
                for item in history_items  
                if item.role in ("user", "assistant")  
            ]  
      
            # STEP 3: Create agent with history context  
            agent = Agent(  
                name="TaskManager",  
                instructions="You are a task management assistant. Maintain conversation continuity.",  
                tools=[]  # Add task management tools  
            )  
      
            # STEP 4: Run agent with history  
            result = Runner.run_streamed(  
                agent=agent,  
                messages=[  
                    *history_messages,  # Previous conversation  
                    {"role": "user", "content": input.content}  # Current input  
                ]  
            )  
      
            # STEP 5: Stream response  
            async for event in stream_agent_response(context, result):  
                yield event  
    

**Output** (user continues conversation from previous session):
    
    
    User: Can you extend it by one week?  
      
    [Agent loads history, sees previous deadline discussion]  
    Agent: Extended deadline from December 31st to January 7th. Task updated.  
    

Agent remembers the December 31st deadline from history and calculates the one-week extension correctly.

**Safety Note** : Always validate thread ownership in production (check `context.user_id` matches thread owner) before loading history. Multi-tenant systems must enforce thread access controls to prevent unauthorized history access.

## Try With AI: Apply Your conversation-history Skill​

You've extracted the conversation history patterns into a reusable skill. Now test it on new scenarios.

### Prompt 1: Semantic Conversation Branching​
    
    
    Using my conversation-history skill, implement conversation branching that  
    loads history from a specific message ID (not just the most recent 20).  
      
    This enables users to "rewind" the conversation to an earlier point and  
    continue from there, creating a conversation tree.  
    

**What you're learning** : How to extend skill patterns beyond the basic implementation. Your skill provides the foundation (load history, serialize), and you add branching logic on top.

### Prompt 2: Multi-User Conversation Filtering​
    
    
    Using my conversation-history skill, modify the history loading to filter by  
    user_id. This enables group chat scenarios where each user only sees messages  
    relevant to them (private DMs mixed with group messages).  
    

**What you're learning** : How to compose skills with security requirements. Your conversation-history skill handles loading/serialization; you add access control filtering.

### Prompt 3: Semantic Summarization​
    
    
    Using my conversation-history skill, add a summarization layer that embeds  
    recent messages verbatim but summarizes older messages to save tokens.  
      
    Recent 10 messages: Full text  
    Messages 11-50: Summarized to 2 sentences each  
    Messages 51+: Single paragraph summary of entire history  
    

**What you're learning** : How skills become platforms for experimentation. Your conversation-history skill provides the primitives (load, serialize, prune); you layer advanced features (embedding, summarization) on top without rewriting the foundation.
