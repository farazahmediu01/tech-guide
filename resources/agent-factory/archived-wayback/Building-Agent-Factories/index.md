# Part 6: Building Agent Factories

Part 6 bridges your foundational skills from Parts 1-5 into production agent development. You've learned Applied Domain Workflows (Part 4) and Python fundamentals (Part 5)—now you'll apply these skills to design, implement, test, and deploy AI agents for real-world applications.

This part introduces agent frameworks, integration patterns, conversational infrastructure, testing strategies, and data persistence—the building blocks of production AI systems. You'll move from educational examples to patterns you'd encounter building professional agent applications.

## Goals​

By completing Part 6, you will:

  * **Understand agent architectures** : Learn how modern agent frameworks (OpenAI Agents SDK, Google ADK, Anthropic Agents Kit) structure agentic systems
  * **Implement integration patterns** : Practice connecting agents through MCP (Model Context Protocol) and building interoperable systems
  * **Build agent APIs** : Create FastAPI endpoints that expose agent capabilities as services
  * **Deploy conversational infrastructure** : Set up ChatKit Server for streaming, sessions, and conversation management
  * **Apply testing strategies** : Practice test-driven development (TDD) and evaluation frameworks (evals) for agent reliability
  * **Implement design patterns** : Build memory, state management, and compositional patterns for complex agent behaviors
  * **Integrate data persistence** : Connect agents to vector databases (RAG), relational databases, and graph databases

## Chapter Progression​

Part 6's 16 chapters build through seven thematic stages:

### Agent Frameworks (Chapters 61-65)​

Establish core agent concepts and framework-specific patterns. Start with agent fundamentals (61), then explore implementation across OpenAI (62), Google (63), and Anthropic (65) platforms using AIDD and spec-driven development.

### Integration Patterns (Chapters 66-68)​

Learn how agents connect and communicate. Understand MCP fundamentals (66), develop custom MCP servers (67), and combine agent skills with MCP code execution for autonomous problem-solving (68).

### Agent Services (Chapters 70-71)​

Transform agents into accessible services. FastAPI for Agents (70) teaches RESTful API patterns, then ChatKit Server (71) adds conversational infrastructure—streaming, sessions, and state management—with a built-in UI for immediate testing.

### Quality Practices (Chapters 72-73)​

Validate agent correctness and reliability. Apply test-driven development patterns (72) and implement comprehensive evaluation frameworks (73) to ensure agents behave as specified.

### Advanced Patterns (Chapters 74-75)​

Handle complexity at scale. Design effective memory and state management (74), and compose agents using multi-agent patterns (75).

### Data Layer (Chapters 76-78)​

Add persistence and knowledge retrieval. Integrate vector databases for RAG (76), relational databases for structured data (77), and graph databases for relationship-rich knowledge (78).

**Why this sequence?** You build conceptual understanding (what are agents?) before diving into integration (how do they connect?), then services (how do users access them?), quality (how do I validate them?), patterns (how do I scale them?), and data (how do I make them persistent?). Each stage builds on previous capabilities.

**By the end of Part 6** , you have a complete local product: an agent with tools, exposed via API, with conversational infrastructure, tested, and connected to persistent data. Part 7 takes this product to the cloud.

## Methodology Note​

Part 6 continues the teaching approach from earlier parts: chapters introduce concepts through hands-on practice, guide you in collaborating with AI to implement solutions, help you build reusable components when patterns recur, and culminate in capstone projects where you apply spec-driven development to compose what you've learned.

You'll experience the same progression—foundation building, AI collaboration, creating reusable intelligence, and specification-first projects—now applied to production agent development rather than language fundamentals.
