Every agent SDK is an abstraction over the Claude API's messages endpoint. Understanding the raw API — `stop_reason`, `tool_use`, `tool_choice`, JSON schemas, and the Batch API — gives you the ability to diagnose any agent behavior, design custom orchestration that SDKs don't support, and make cost/latency tradeoffs that production systems require.

## What You'll Learn​

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

  * Construct raw Messages API requests and parse responses (content blocks, stop_reason values)
  * Define tools with effective descriptions and handle the tool_use/tool_result conversation loop
  * Build a complete agentic loop that runs autonomously until `stop_reason: "end_turn"`
  * Control tool selection with `tool_choice` (auto, any, forced) for multi-step pipelines
  * Enforce structured output via `tool_use` with JSON Schemas (nullable fields, enum + "other", format rules)
  * Implement validation-retry loops with Pydantic for extraction quality
  * Use the Message Batches API for 50% cost savings on latency-tolerant workloads


## Chapter Structure​

  1. **The Messages API — Anatomy of a Request and Response** — model, max_tokens, system prompt, messages array, content blocks, stop_reason values
  2. **Tool Definitions and Tool Use** — tool schemas, effective descriptions, tool_use response handling, tool_result format, tool distribution principles
  3. **The Agentic Loop** — the complete autonomous loop pattern, model-driven decision making, anti-patterns the certification exam tests
  4. **tool_choice — Controlling Tool Selection** — auto vs any vs forced, multi-step forced selection patterns
  5. **Structured Output via tool_use with JSON Schemas** — schema design patterns, semantic validation, format normalization
  6. **Validation-Retry Loops for Extraction Quality** — retry-with-error-feedback, Pydantic integration, when retries succeed vs fail
  7. **The Message Batches API** — 50% cost savings, 24-hour processing window, failure handling, batch submission frequency


## Running Project​

Students build a complete structured data extraction pipeline using raw API calls, progressing from simple extraction to validation-retry to batch processing.

## Prerequisites​

  * Chapter 61: Introduction to AI Agents (conceptual foundation)
  * Part 4: Python proficiency (async/await, type hints)
  * Anthropic API key with Claude access
