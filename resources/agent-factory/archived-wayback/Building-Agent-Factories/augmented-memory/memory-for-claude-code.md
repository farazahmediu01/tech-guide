You've built agents with memory from scratch. Now experience memory from the other side—as the user of a memory-augmented assistant.

The [claude-mem](<https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem>) plugin gives Claude Code persistent memory across sessions. It remembers your preferences, project context, and past decisions, making every conversation build on what came before.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a memory-augmented Claude Code that knows your development style.

## Installation​

### From Plugin Marketplace​
    
    
    # In Claude Code terminal  
    /plugin marketplace add thedotmack/claude-mem  
    

Or install directly:
    
    
    /plugin install claude-mem  
    

### Verify Installation​

After installation, restart Claude Code and check:
    
    
    /plugins  
    

**Output:**
    
    
    Installed plugins:  
    • claude-mem (v1.0.0) - Active  
      Hooks: SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse, Stop, SessionEnd  
      MCP Tools: search, timeline, get_observations  
    

### Configuration Location​

The plugin stores configuration and data in:
    
    
    ~/.claude-mem/  
    ├── settings.json      # Configuration  
    ├── memory.db          # SQLite storage  
    └── chroma/            # Vector embeddings  
    

## How It Works​

Claude-mem uses **lifecycle hooks** to capture and retrieve memories automatically:

    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  
    

### Hook Behavior​

Hook| When| What It Captures  
---|---|---  
`SessionStart`| Conversation begins| Retrieves relevant past context  
`UserPromptSubmit`| User sends message| User intent and questions  
`PostToolUse`| After each tool| Tool results and patterns  
`Stop`| Response complete| Session insights and decisions  
`SessionEnd`| Session closes| Finalizes and indexes memories  
  
## Privacy Controls​

### The `<private>` Tag​

Anything wrapped in `<private>` tags is **never stored** :
    
    
    Can you help me debug this API call?  
    <private>  
    API_KEY=sk-1234567890abcdef  
    DB_PASSWORD=supersecret123  
    </private>  
    The error is a 401 Unauthorized.  
    

Claude-mem will store: "User asked for help debugging API call, getting 401 Unauthorized error."

It will **not** store: API keys, passwords, or anything between `<private>` tags.

### Configuration Settings​

Edit `~/.claude-mem/settings.json`:
    
    
    {  
      "privacy": {  
        "enabled": true,  
        "excluded_patterns": [  
          "password",  
          "api_key",  
          "api-key",  
          "secret",  
          "token",  
          "bearer",  
          "credential",  
          "private_key",  
          "ssh_key",  
          "-----BEGIN"  
        ],  
        "excluded_paths": [  
          "**/.env*",  
          "**/secrets/**",  
          "**/.ssh/**",  
          "**/credentials/**"  
        ]  
      },  
      "storage": {  
        "path": "~/.claude-mem",  
        "max_observations": 10000,  
        "retention_days": 365  
      },  
      "retrieval": {  
        "max_results": 10,  
        "relevance_threshold": 0.5,  
        "recency_weight": 0.3  
      }  
    }  
    

### Privacy Audit​

Run a privacy check on stored memories:
    
    
    # In terminal (not Claude Code)  
    cd ~/.claude-mem  
    sqlite3 memory.db "SELECT content FROM observations WHERE content LIKE '%password%' OR content LIKE '%api_key%' OR content LIKE '%secret%';"  
    

If this returns results, review and clean up:
    
    
    sqlite3 memory.db "DELETE FROM observations WHERE content LIKE '%password%';"  
    

## Web UI​

Claude-mem includes a web interface for exploring your memories.

### Starting the Web UI​
    
    
    # The server starts automatically with the plugin  
    # Access at:  
    open http://localhost:37777

## MCP Tools​

Claude-mem adds MCP tools for memory operations within Claude Code.

### Available Tools​

**`search`** \- Semantic memory search
    
    
    Use the search tool to find memories about Python testing preferences  
    

**`timeline`** \- Recent observations
    
    
    Show me my memory timeline from the last 7 days  
    

**`get_observations`** \- Retrieve specific observations
    
    
    Get observations about the Phoenix project  
    

### Using MCP Tools in Conversation​

**Example 1: Context Retrieval**
    
    
    You: What have I been working on lately?  
      
    Claude: [Uses timeline tool]  
    Based on your recent activity:  
    - This week: Phoenix project authentication module  
    - Focus: FastAPI endpoints and SQLModel integration  
    - Testing: Using pytest with async fixtures  
      
    You mentioned yesterday that the connection pool issue was  
    caused by missing cleanup in the context manager.  
    

**Example 2: Preference Lookup**
    
    
    You: How do I usually structure my models?  
      
    Claude: [Uses search tool with "model structure preferences"]  
    From our past conversations, you prefer:  
    - SQLModel for FastAPI projects (combines SQLAlchemy + Pydantic)  
    - Repository pattern for data access  
    - Separate Base classes from Table classes  
      
    Here's the pattern you've used before:  
    [Shows code from past context]  
    

### The `mem-search` Skill​

Claude-mem includes a built-in skill for natural language memory queries:
    
    
    /mem-search testing frameworks I've used  
      
    Results:  
    1. [2025-01-20] Uses pytest, prefers fixtures over setup/teardown  
    2. [2025-01-15] Tried pytest-asyncio for async test support  
    3. [2025-01-10] Mentioned avoiding unittest in favor of pytest  
    

## Experiencing Memory-Augmented Claude Code​

### First Session​
    
    
    You: Hi, I'm starting a new Python project using FastAPI.  
      
    Claude: Great! I'll remember that you're working with FastAPI.  
    What kind of project is it?  
      
    You: It's a task management API. I prefer using SQLModel and pytest.  
      
    Claude: Perfect! I've noted your preferences:  
    - Framework: FastAPI  
    - ORM: SQLModel (nice choice - combines SQLAlchemy with Pydantic)  
    - Testing: pytest  
      
    Want me to help set up the project structure?  
    

### Second Session (Next Day)​
    
    
    You: Let's continue working on the project  
      
    Claude: Welcome back! I remember you're building a task management  
    API with FastAPI + SQLModel. Yesterday we discussed the project  
    structure. Where would you like to pick up?  
      
    You: I need to add user authentication  
      
    Claude: For your FastAPI project, I'd suggest using python-jose  
    for JWT tokens - it works well with SQLModel. Based on your  
    preference for clean architecture, here's a pattern:  
      
    [Shows auth structure consistent with past decisions]  
    

### The Memory Difference​

Without Memory| With Memory  
---|---  
"What framework?"| "Your FastAPI project..."  
Generic examples| Examples using your stack  
Repeated explanations| Builds on past context  
Starting fresh| Continuous relationship  
  
## Workflow Patterns​

### Pattern 1: Project Onboarding​

When starting a new project, explicitly set context:
    
    
    I'm starting a new project called "PaymentGateway":  
    - Stack: FastAPI, SQLModel, Redis for caching  
    - Architecture: Hexagonal with ports and adapters  
    - Testing: pytest with 80% coverage target  
    - Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes  
      
    Remember this context for our future conversations.  
    

### Pattern 2: Decision Documentation​

When making important decisions:
    
    
    We decided to use Stripe over PayPal for payments because:  
    - Better API documentation  
    - Native Python SDK  
    - Webhook reliability  
      
    Please remember this decision and the reasoning.  
    

### Pattern 3: Error Patterns​

After debugging:
    
    
    Found the issue: SQLModel relationship lazy loading fails in async.  
    Solution: Use selectinload() for async relationship queries.  
      
    Remember this pattern - it's likely to come up again.  
    

### Pattern 4: Privacy-Aware Sharing​

When sharing sensitive context:
    
    
    The payment integration uses:  
    <private>  
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...  
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...  
    </private>  
      
    The webhook endpoint is /api/webhooks/stripe  
    

## What Makes Memory Feel Right​

After using memory-augmented Claude Code, these patterns create value:

### ✅ What Works​

**Preference Persistence**
    
    
    Week 1: "I prefer async/await over .then() chains"  
    Week 4: Claude automatically uses async/await in suggestions  
    

**Project Context**
    
    
    "The Phoenix project uses microservices with Kafka"  
    Later: Claude suggests Kafka patterns for related features  
    

**Error Memory**
    
    
    "That connection pool bug was from missing cleanup"  
    Later: Claude proactively mentions cleanup patterns  
    

### ❌ What Feels Intrusive​

**Over-remembering**
    
    
    ❌ "You mentioned liking pizza last month"  
       → Not relevant to coding  
    

**Stale Context**
    
    
    ❌ "Based on your preference for React..."  
       → You've since switched to Vue (update preferences!)  
    

**Wrong Confidence**
    
    
    ❌ "You always use X pattern"  
       → You used it once (memory conflates frequency)  
    

### The Balance​

Good memory feels like working with a colleague who knows your style. Bad memory feels like surveillance.

The difference: **relevance** and **recency**.

## Try With AI​

Use these prompts to explore memory-augmented development.

### Prompt 1: Configure Your Memory Profile​
    
    
    I just installed claude-mem and want to set up my memory profile.  
    Help me create initial memories for:  
      
    1. My development preferences:  
       - Languages I use most  
       - Frameworks I prefer  
       - Testing approach  
       - Code style preferences  
      
    2. Current project context:  
       - What I'm building  
       - Architecture decisions  
       - Key constraints  
      
    3. Privacy settings I should configure:  
       - Patterns to exclude  
       - File paths to ignore  
      
    Walk me through each category and suggest specific memories to store.  
    

**What you're learning:** Explicit initial configuration sets the foundation for useful memory. Random accumulation leads to noise.

### Prompt 2: Memory Maintenance Routine​
    
    
    I've been using claude-mem for 3 months and want to do maintenance.  
    Design a monthly memory hygiene routine:  
      
    1. How to identify stale memories (outdated preferences, old projects)  
    2. How to find and remove potentially sensitive stored data  
    3. How to consolidate redundant memories  
    4. How to update preferences that have changed  
    5. A checklist I can follow each month  
      
    Include the actual commands and queries I should run.  
    

**What you're learning:** Memory systems need maintenance. Without periodic cleanup, they accumulate noise that degrades retrieval quality.

### Prompt 3: Project Memory Template​
    
    
    I'm about to start a new project. Create a memory template that I can  
    fill out at project start to give Claude Code the right context:  
      
    Template should include:  
    1. Project identity (name, type, goals)  
    2. Technical stack (languages, frameworks, databases)  
    3. Architecture decisions and rationale  
    4. Coding standards and patterns to follow  
    5. Testing requirements  
    6. Known constraints or challenges  
      
    Format it so I can copy-paste and fill in the blanks, then share  
    with Claude Code to establish project memory.  
    

**What you're learning:** Structured project onboarding creates better memory than organic accumulation. Templates ensure consistent, useful context.

## What You've Learned​

This chapter took you from understanding why agents need memory to using memory-augmented tools:

Lesson| Key Concept  
---|---  
L01| Context window problem and stateless vs stateful  
L02| Five memory types: conversation, working, episodic, semantic  
L03| Relevance scoring and privacy-compliant forgetting  
L04| Retrieval strategies: recency, relevance, entity, hybrid  
L05| Context window management and summarization chains  
L06| Mem0 SDK implementation for Task API  
L07| Production patterns: injection, retrieval, conflicts  
L08| Building complete memory-augmented agents  
L09| Memory for Claude Code with claude-mem plugin  
  
You now understand memory from both sides—as the builder and as the user. That dual perspective is essential for creating agents that people actually want to use.

## Next Steps​

With memory in place, your agents can maintain context across sessions. The next chapter explores how to evaluate whether your agents actually work—testing strategies for AI systems that don't have deterministic outputs.
