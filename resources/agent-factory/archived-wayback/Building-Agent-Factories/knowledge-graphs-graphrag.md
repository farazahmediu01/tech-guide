**Part 6: AI Native Software Development — Phase 3: Data & Memory**

This chapter teaches you how to build knowledge graphs and implement GraphRAG (Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for AI agents. You'll learn when graph structures outperform vector similarity, how to model domain knowledge as graphs, and how to combine graph traversal with LLM reasoning.

## What You'll Learn​

  * **Knowledge Graph Fundamentals** : Nodes, edges, properties, and graph schemas
  * **Graph Databases** : Neo4j and lightweight alternatives for agent applications
  * **GraphRAG Architecture** : Combining graph traversal with vector retrieval
  * **Entity Extraction** : Automatically building graphs from unstructured text
  * **Multi-hop Reasoning** : Traversing relationships for complex queries
  * **Hybrid RAG** : When to use graphs vs vectors vs both


## Prerequisites​

  * **Chapter 73** : Vector Databases & RAG (vector retrieval foundations)
  * **Chapter 74** : Relational Databases for Agents (data modeling concepts)
  * **Chapters 62-65** : Agent SDK fundamentals


## Key Technologies​

Technology| Purpose  
---|---  
**Neo4j**|  Production graph database  
**LangChain GraphRAG**|  Graph-enhanced retrieval  
**NetworkX**|  Lightweight graph operations  
**Entity Extraction**|  Building graphs from text  
  
## Running Example​

Extend the Task API with knowledge graph capabilities:

  * Task dependencies as graph relationships
  * Project hierarchies and team structures
  * Multi-hop queries: "Show all tasks blocking the Q1 release"

> **Note** : This chapter is under development. Lessons will cover graph fundamentals through production GraphRAG implementation.
