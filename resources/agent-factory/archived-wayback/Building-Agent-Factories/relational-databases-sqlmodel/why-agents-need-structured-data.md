Your Task Manager agent just helped a user create 50 tasks across 5 projects. The user assigned workers, set priorities, added tags. Then the server restarted.

Everything is gone.

This isn't a hypothetical disaster—it's what happens when agents store data only in memory. The moment your process ends, your users lose their work.

## The Persistence Problem​

Consider what your Task Manager agent tracks:

Data| Type| Lifetime  
---|---|---  
Tasks| Structured records| Permanent  
Projects| Related records| Permanent  
Worker assignments| Relationships| Permanent  
Conversation history| Sequential| Session or permanent  
Search embeddings| Vectors| Permanent  
  
Memory handles conversation flow during a session. But tasks, projects, assignments—these must survive restarts, scale across instances, and remain consistent when multiple users access them simultaneously.

You need a database.

## Relational vs Vector: Different Questions​

You learned about vector databases in Chapter 73. They answer semantic questions:

  * "Find tasks similar to 'fix authentication'"
  * "What documents discuss deployment?"
  * "Show me related concepts"


Relational databases answer structured questions:

  * "List all pending tasks for Project X"
  * "Who is assigned to Task #42?"
  * "How many tasks did each worker complete this week?"

Question Type| Database| Why  
---|---|---  
"Similar to..."| Vector| Semantic similarity search  
"Filter by..."| Relational| Exact matching, ordering  
"Count/sum..."| Relational| Aggregation queries  
"Related to..."| Both| Depends on relationship type  
  
Your agent needs both. Vector DB for semantic search. Relational DB for structured queries and persistent state.

## ACID: Why Agents Need Guarantees​

When your agent updates the database, things can go wrong. Network drops. Server crashes. Two users edit the same task simultaneously.

ACID properties protect you:

**Atomicity** : All-or-nothing operations. If your agent creates a task with 5 subtasks, either all 6 records exist or none do. No half-created task trees.
    
    
    # Either both succeed or both fail  
    async with session.begin():  
        session.add(parent_task)  
        for subtask in subtasks:  
            session.add(subtask)  
    

**Consistency** : Rules always hold. If your schema says `project_id` must reference a valid project, the database rejects orphan tasks. Your agent can't accidentally create invalid data.

**Isolation** : Concurrent operations don't conflict. Two agents updating different tasks on the same project don't corrupt each other's work.

**Durability** : Once committed, data survives crashes. Your user's 50 tasks persist through server restarts, power failures, and deployments.

## Why Async Matters for Agents​

Your agent does many things:

  * Receives user requests
  * Calls LLM APIs
  * Reads and writes database
  * Sends responses


Synchronous database access blocks everything. While waiting for a query, your agent can't process other requests.
    
    
    # SYNC: Blocks entire process  
    def get_tasks(project_id):  
        return db.query(Task).filter_by(project_id=project_id).all()  
        # Nothing else happens until this returns  
      
    # ASYNC: Process continues while waiting  
    async def get_tasks(project_id):  
        result = await session.exec(select(Task).where(Task.project_id == project_id))  
        return result.all()  
        # Other requests processed while waiting  
    

Async database access lets your agent:

  * Handle multiple concurrent users
  * Process API responses while queries run
  * Scale to production workloads


This is why we use `create_async_engine` and `AsyncSession` exclusively in this chapter.

## The Task Manager Data Model​

Throughout this chapter, you'll build a database layer for the Task Manager:
    
    
    Project  
      └── Task (many)  
           ├── Worker (assigned)  
           ├── Worker (created_by)  
           └── Task (subtasks - self-referential)  
    

This structure exercises:

  * One-to-many relationships (Project → Tasks)
  * Many-to-one with multiple foreign keys (Task → Worker for two purposes)
  * Self-referential relationships (Task → parent/subtasks)
  * JSONB columns (tags, metadata)


By chapter end, you'll have a complete async database layer matching production patterns.

## Try With AI​

### Prompt 1: Classify Your Data​
    
    
    I'm building an AI agent that manages customer support tickets.  
    It tracks:  
    - Ticket records with status, priority, assignee  
    - Customer information  
    - Similar past tickets for context  
    - Conversation history with customers  
      
    For each data type, recommend: relational database, vector database,  
    or both? Explain your reasoning based on how the data will be queried.  
    

**What you're learning:** Database selection based on query patterns—matching data characteristics to appropriate storage.

### Prompt 2: Design for Reliability​
    
    
    My agent creates a Project with 10 Tasks in a single user request.  
    What ACID property ensures that if task #7 fails to save,  
    the entire operation rolls back including the Project and tasks 1-6?  
      
    Show me the Python code pattern that implements this guarantee  
    using SQLModel's async session.  
    

**What you're learning:** Atomicity in practice—understanding how transactions protect data integrity.

### Prompt 3: Justify Async​
    
    
    My agent currently uses synchronous database access and handles  
    about 10 requests per second. I want to scale to 100 requests  
    per second without adding more servers.  
      
    Explain how async database access helps, and what changes  
    I need to make to my SQLModel code to achieve this.  
    

**What you're learning:** Async performance reasoning—understanding why async matters for scale.

### Safety Note​

Database operations can fail. Always handle connection errors, query timeouts, and constraint violations. Your agent should gracefully inform users when database issues occur rather than crashing silently.

## Reflect on Your Skill​

You built a `relational-db-agent` skill in Lesson 0. Test its understanding of these concepts.

### Test Your Skill​
    
    
    Using my relational-db-agent skill, explain when I should  
    use a relational database vs a vector database for my agent.  
    Give me a decision framework.  
    

### Identify Gaps​

Ask yourself:

  * Did my skill distinguish structured queries from semantic search?
  * Did it mention ACID properties?
  * Did it recommend async patterns?


### Improve Your Skill​

If you found gaps:
    
    
    My relational-db-agent skill doesn't explain when to use  
    relational vs vector databases. Add guidance that:  
    - Relational: exact matching, filtering, aggregation, relationships  
    - Vector: semantic similarity, fuzzy matching, context retrieval  
    - Often use both in agent architectures  
    

Your skill now helps you make better architectural decisions.
